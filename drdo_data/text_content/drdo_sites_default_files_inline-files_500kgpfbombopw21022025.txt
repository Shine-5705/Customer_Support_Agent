Manufacturing of 500kg Pre-fragmented (PF) Bomb

The   500kg   pre-fragmentation   (PF)   Bomb   consists   of   Bomb   Body  Assembly   and   the   Pre-Fragmented
Module (PFM). The Bomb Body Assembly  is the metallic portion consisting of Bomb body and the Tail
Unit. The cylindrical portion of bomb body and the Tail Unit are made using steel sheet while the head
section of bomb body is made by machining of steel casting/forging/bur stock. The structure is sufficient to
provide structural integrity for handling, transportation and during flight.

The PF Module is made of FRP manufactured by filament winding process using 3-axis filament winding
machine. Initially a FRP shell is made over the front and rear inserts. Steel balls are packed close to one
another using resin in two layers over this FRP layer. Then a top layer of FRP is laid to hold the spheres
firmly in place and is machined to dimensions.

The empty PFM is inserted into the bomb body from the rear end. The PFM is held securely in the front
through fasteners, on the sides with threaded Lug housings and on the rear through Interfacing ring with
fasteners. This makes the PFM completely integral with the bomb body. The Bomb Body-PFM assembly is
filled   with  explosive.  After   filling,   tail   unit   assembly   is   integrated   to   the   filled   Bomb-PFM   assembly
through Interface Ring using fasteners. This bomb is initiated with a proximity fuze fitted in nose/base
(with a proximity sensor at nose).
