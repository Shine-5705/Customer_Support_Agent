50mm IR Flare

Infrared (IR) guided missiles pose a major threat to military aircraft. For aerial
intercept mission, a vast number of IR guided air-to –air missiles have been
developed around the world. Military as well as civilian aircraft/ helicopters
are prone to attack by ground to air and air to air IR guided missiles. The IR
flare   is   used   to   seduce   an   IR   seeker   away   from   the   target   by   having   a
stronger signature than that of the target itself.

⌀50mm IR flare is a Dia 50mm size cartridge, which produces an intense IR
radiation in the desired waveband for more than 5s duration on initiation. The
IR   Flares   are   used   to   protect   the   aircraft   from   heat   seeking   missiles.   The
Flare   has   an   electrically   operated   Impulse   cartridge   (IC).   Once   electrical
pulse is provided by the aircraft, the IC functions and produces a flash, and
gas pressure is generated over the Safety and Functioning Unit (SFU). The
SFU has a spring loaded slider. Once the SFU along with the flare pellet is
ejected out of the container, the flash is provided to the flare pellet which
ignites in the air producing very intense IR radiations.
