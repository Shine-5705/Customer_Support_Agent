Condensed Aerosol Based Fire Extinguishing System (CAFES)

CAFES

Capacity: 0.1 kg AFC

Capacity: 1.0 kg AFC

India is a signatory country on Montreal protocol-1987, and ban on production and use of

Halon is applicable for our fire safety systems. Several Halon alternatives are being developed

worldwide. Condensed aerosol based fire extinguishing system (CAFES) has emerged as the

most efficient Halon alternative as it is three times more effective than Halon-1301 on weight to

volume bases, modular, simple, non-toxic, and environmentally safe. 

Basically, CAFES is comprised of igniter, aerosol forming composite (AFC) and cooling pallets

composite   (CPC)   housed   in   suitable   casing.   When   the   actuation   signal   is   sent   to   igniter   of

CAFES. Igniter burns booster composite and in turn AFC, and finally produces micron size

aerosols of potassium carbonate/bicarbonate and hot gases, which are cooled by CPC and the

combustion   products   (aerosols   and   gases)   come   out   of   CAFES.   In   the   fire   zone,   produced

aerosols inhibit the fire sustaining free radical chain reaction of fuel and thereby extinguishes the

fire. 

Indigenously designed & developed CAFES of capacity 0.1 and 1.0 kg AFC have been

tested by CFEES as per relevant performance parameters of international standards. The current

technology  for transfer involves  complete  details  on process of preparation  of AFC & CPC

chemical composites, their blocks & tablets, design of igniter and various components of casings

of CAFES, housing protocols and clamping arrangements.
