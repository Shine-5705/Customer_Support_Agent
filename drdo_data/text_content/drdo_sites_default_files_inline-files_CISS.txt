COMPACT INTEGRATED SHIELDING SET (CISS) (PARIDHI RAKSHAK) 

Existing Shield and lathi used during handling of riot - situation is designed according to 
male  anthropometry  like  stature, body  circumferences and  hand dimension.  It  was  too 
big  in  terms  of  its  length  and  breadth for the  women  and  hinders  their  performance  in 
action  role.  Female  troops find  some difficulties  to  use  due  to  its size,  shape  of  shield 
and lathi which often compromises their safety due to ergonomic mismatch. To address 
this,  Defence  Institute  of  Physiology  and  Allied  Sciences  (DIPAS)  has  designed  and 
female  body 
developed  polycarbonate  shield  and 
anthropometry. The strength and visibility through the shield has been improved and the 
design has been changed to strengthen the grip.
