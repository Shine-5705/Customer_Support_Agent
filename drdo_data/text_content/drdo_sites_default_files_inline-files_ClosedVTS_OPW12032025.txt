Closed Vessel Test System

The Closed Vessel   test is the only method to determine the rate of burning of propellants
experimentally. It is performed for the following purposes:

Experimental determination of ballistic properties of gun propellants for 

(a)
control during R&D and manufacturing.  

quality

(b) 

Assessment of propellant usefulness during its life.  

(c)   Verifying Force Constant (J/g) and co-volume of a propellant through 
analysis.

thermochemical

Hardware

In   the   CV   test,   a   known   quantity   of   gun   propellant   is   burnt   inside   a   closed   Combustion
Chamber   of   known   volume.   The   combustion   chamber   is   a   cylindrical   vessel   of   robust
construction, capable of withstanding high pressure resulting from such experiments. At one
end, it is closed by the firing block, with the provision of igniting the propellant charge and
release of gases at the end of each experiment. The other end is closed by the gauge block,
which facilitates provision for recording of pressure transient inside CV.

Software

During the burning of  propellants inside  the  Combustion Chamber, pressure  rise  in closed
vessel  is a fast event of about 5-25 milliseconds, Therefore, CV Data Acquisition  Software
(CVDAS) has been designed and developed in-house. The software presents a very friendly
user interface and displays results and graphs immediately after a firing.

Testing Methodology

The   propellant   charge   is   ignited   by   a   small   amount   (1.2g)   of   gunpowder   charge   which   is
confined in a cotton bag. This gun powder bag is ignited by passing a current (3-5 Amps)
through   a   short   length   of   fine   Ni-chrome   wire   fixed   across   the   firing   pins.   A   tourmaline
piezoelectric pressure transducer is used to record the pressure transient developed inside
CV. The pressure-time- data is the basic data output from firing a propellant. From this data
other required ballistic performance parameters are evaluated. 

Status of technology

The   CV   facility   is   being   used   in   HEMRL   and   it   is   a   well-established   laboratory   set-up   to
evaluate performance parameters of gun propellants, during development and production.
