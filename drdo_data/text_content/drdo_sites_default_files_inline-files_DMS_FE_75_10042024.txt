Fluorocarbon Rubber Compound (DMS-FE-75)

Fluorocarbon elastomer designated as FKM according to ISO 1629 contains high fluorine content

i.e. 67±3%  (approx.). This rubber compound is stable better over wide temperature range and

possesses excellent resistance to weather, oil, and atmospheric agent. They have good resistance

to compression set, ozone and swelling (except some polar solvents and low molecular weight

organic acids). 

Keeping in view of outstanding characteristic of fluorocarbon polymer, DMSRDE has developed

the fluorocarbon-based rubber compound known as DMS-FE-75 having hardness between 75 and

83  Shore  ‘A’  and   brittleness   temperature  is   -40oC.   DMS-FE-75  is  the   best   solution  for   high

temperature application i.e. 200oC (for continuous operation) and 300oC (for intermittent time

period). Components developed from DMS-FE-75 rubber compound are being widely used in

aero-engine and other hydraulic control system of transport aircrafts, fighter aircrafts, helicopters,

etc.
