Solar Thermal Technology based System for Space Heating of Shelter
in Cold Condition

DIHAR   (DRDO)   has   developed   a   system   consisting   of   solar   thermal   technology

arranged   in   separate   loops   for   capturing   the   solar   energy   and   converting   solar

radiation into thermal energy. The technology transfers its thermal energy to the two

different   fluids   with   different   specific   heat   capacity   and   boiling   &   freezing

temperatures and a latent heat storage material. The process keeps on repeating and

heats the sensible and latent heat storage material throughout the sunny day time. The

heated heat transfer fluid flows through insulated pipes aided by pumps and stored

thermal energies in two separate insulated storage tanks of different capacities. The

flow of heated fluid is auto regulated based on the predefined temperature limits from

solar thermal technologies to tanks and from tanks to the shelter. The heated fluid

stored in insulated tank is subsequently used to maintain the comfortable habitable

temperature (17±3℃) inside shelter through a combination of insulated pipes, pump

and units. The whole system is automatically regulated with the help of sensors and

related  accessories   to   save   the   energy  so   as   to   prolong   the   stored  thermal  energy

utilization for maintenance of shelter temperature in the required temperature range .It

also   has   control   panel   with   LCD   display   to   monitor   the   temperatures   sensed   by

numbers of sensors with automatic data storage and easy data transfer facility.
