Design of passive underground structure for storage of fresh food in high altitude

High altitude regions like ladakh hold great strategic importance due to sharing of the border
with neighbouring nations. As a result, the focus of military deployment is heavily concentrated in
the  regions.  To fulfill  the  food  and  nutritional  requiremnt  of troops   deployed  in  Ladakh,  fresh
vegetables & fruits are procured from local farmers and transported by air and road from other part
of the country. Lot of fresh food is spoiled in sub zero temperature during winters due to lack of
adequate storage facility. This results in heavy exchequer with deterioration in quality of the fresh
food.
          Energy reuirement is the main concern to design, adequate storage facility in high altitude
conditions. In order to cater this issue, DIHAR has developed the design of passive underground
structure for storage of fresh vegetables and fruits that utilizes geothermal energy to maintain the
adequate temperature inside the store when outside temperature goes upto -250  C.   The required
humidity is also regulated inside the structure according to the stored varieties of vegetables and
fruits.

On the basis of study on various quality ( physical and biochemical) parameters it has been
observed that certain vegetables and fruit can be stored from November to March/April without
compromising   the   quality.   Designs   of   simulated   strucures   of   diffrent   capacity   have   also   been
extended from the existing structure. The design details along with structural drawings will be
provided under the ToT.
