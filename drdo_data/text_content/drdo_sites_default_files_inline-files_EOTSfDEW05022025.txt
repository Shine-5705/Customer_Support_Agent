Electro Optical Tracking System (EOTS)  for Directed Energy Weapon 

Electro Optical Tracking System for Directed Energy Weapons is a high performance electro 

optical  stabilized  gimbal  system  integrated  with  video  tracker  which  facilitates  battlefield 

surveillance,  target  acquisition  and  auto  tracking  during  day  as  well  as  night  on  a  static  and 

dynamic platform.  It consists of EO sensors viz. Thermal Imager, Day TV and Eye Safe Laser 

range  finder  and  beam  directing  optical  channels  as  payloads.  Continuous  target  tracking 

capability  facilitates  high  precision  beam  pointing  on  the  target.    The  system  is  capable  of 

tracking the targets like UAVs and Drones at a range of 5 Kms.  This Electro Optical Tracking 

Systems  has  a  unique  feature  of  autonomous  tracking  of  the  target  after  receiving  a  cue 

command from external source like RADAR.
