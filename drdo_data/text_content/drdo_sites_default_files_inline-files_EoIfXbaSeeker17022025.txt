A Brief on X-Band MPM for Brahmos Seeker 

X-band  MPM  based  transmitter  is  one  of  the  critical  sub-system  of  brahmos  seeker  used  in 

terminal  guidance  of  the  missile  towards  the  target.  With  the  recent  trends  in  precision 

guided  weapons,  the active  RF  seekers  have  become  rudimentary  part  of most  of  the 

missile  platforms  owing  to  its  high  hit-to-kill  capability  in  all-weather  conditions. 

Transmitter  is  one  of  the  critical  subsystems  of  the  RF  seeker  which  consumes  the 

maximum power as well as the size, weight and volume. The challenging requirements 

in  size,  weight  and  power  with  increased  functionality  and  performance  makes  the 

transmitter technology very critical for the overall system engineering and performance. 

An  X-band  compact  transmitter  is  developed  based  on  microwave  power  module 

architecture with solid State Power Amplifier (SSPA) as the driver amplifier followed by 

a  power  booster  mini  Travelling  Wave  Tube  (TWT)  for  achieving  better  efficiency  and 

noise  performance.  Microwave  Tube  Research  &  Development  Centre  (MTRDC)  has 

successfully  developed  X-band  transmitter  technology  to  meet  the  airborne  seeker 

requirement for defence application. 

Interested  industries  are  requested  to  forward  their  Expression  of  Interest  (EoI)  (with 

attachments of supporting documents) to Centre Head, MTRDC with a copy to Director 

DIITM, DRDO HQ (without attachment) on following address:-
