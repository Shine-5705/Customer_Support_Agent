G-Band Coupled Cavity Traveling-Wave Tube (G-Band CCTWT) 

G-band  Coupled  Cavity  Traveling-Wave  Tube  (G-Band  CCTWT)  is  a  microwave  tube 

amplifier for the existing Radars such as Weapon Locating Radar (WLR), Troop Level 

Radar (TLR)  and  Flight  Level  Radar  (FLR).  G-Band  CCTWT is  a water  cooled  device 

which  uses  special  UHV  grade  materials  for  the  fabrication  of  precision  components 

that are brazed and welded for the assembly of G-band CC-TWT. Development of this 

class of TWTs requires specialised development facilities and expertise in the area of 

vacuum electron tubes. 

MTRDC has successfully developed and tested several G-band CCTWTs to confirm its 

suitability  for  defence  applications.  The  technology  is  matured  and  available  for  mass 

production to meet defence requirements. 

Interested  industries  are  requested  to  forward  their  Expression  of  Interest  (EoI)  (with 

supporting documents) to Centre Head, MTRDC with a copy to Director DIITM, DRDO
