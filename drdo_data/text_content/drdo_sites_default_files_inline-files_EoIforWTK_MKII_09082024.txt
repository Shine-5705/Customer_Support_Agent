Water  Test  Kit-Il  (WTK  Mk-Il) 

Water  Test  Kit  Mk-Il  developed  by  Defence  R&D  Establishment  Gwalior  is 

a  manual 

detection  device  capable  of  detecting  contaminants  such  as  heavy  metals  (Mercury, 

Manganese,  Copper,  Lead,  Arsenic),  blood  agent  (CN),  microbial  contaminant  (fecal 

bacteria)  and  chemical  warfare  agents  (HD  and  Nerve  agents)  in  water  sources  like 

reservoirs,  tanks,  wells  etc.  in  field  during  the  hostile  environment  and  also  for  routine 

testing  under  normal  conditions.  Based  on  colorimetric  tests  the  kit  is  housed  in  FRP
