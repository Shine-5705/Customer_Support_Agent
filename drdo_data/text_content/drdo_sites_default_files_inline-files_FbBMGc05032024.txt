Fe based Bulk Metallic glass (BMG) coatings (NMR-FeBMG) 

Bulk  metallic  glasses 

three-dimensional  periodic 
(BMGs)  do  not  possess 
arrangements  of  atoms  and  hence  do  not  have  “crystalline  defects”.  As  a  result,  bulk 
metallic  glasses  exhibit  high  strength,  hardness,  high  elastic  strain,  erosion-corrosion 
resistance,  and  soft  magnetic  properties  compared  to  conventional  crystalline  metallic 
materials.  BMGs  have  exceptional  elastic  strain  limit  and  resilience  far  exceeding  any 
conventional metallic material.  

DRDO  lab,  NMRL  has  developed  Fe  based  BMG  coatings  using  HVOF  technique. 
These  coatings  has  hardness  ranging  minimum  from  750  VHN,  high  corrosion  & 
erosion–corrosion  resistance  equivalent  to  wrought  super  duplex  stainless  steel.  These 
coatings possess good adhesion strength, porosity less than 2 %, surface finish in microns 
after grinding. These coatings may be used in the place of hard chrome plating and WC 
coatings.
