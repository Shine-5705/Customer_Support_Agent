Germanium Single Crystal Growth for Infrared Optics

Germanium  is the  preferred  material for fabrication  of lens and  window  material  for  high
performance infrared imaging and sensing systems in the 2–12 µm wavelength owing to itslarge
refractive   index,   high   infrared   transmission   and   good   machinability.   Hence,   Germaniumsingle
crystals are  widely used  for the  fabrication  of infrared  optics in  the  form of lenses, prisms and
windows in various infrared devices. Keeping, the huge requirement of infrared detectors for various
strategic   defence   and   space   applications   under   consideration,   large   number   Germanium   single
crystals are required for the fabrication of various optical components which are imported at a high
cost. Hence, SSPL has indigenously developed the technology to grow optical quality Germanium
single crystals and fabrication of blanks. SSPL developed Germanium blanks have been used both
by other DRDO laboratories and outside production agencies for fabrication of infrared lenses which
have   been   extensively   tested   and   the   performance   have   been   found   at   par   with   the   imported
materials.   Typical   specifications   of   grown   Germanium   crystals   include   diameter   ≥   100   mm,
Resistivity 5-30Ωcm, and Infrared transmission ≥ 45% in 2-12 µm range.

Interested   industries   are   requested   to   submit   their   financial   bid   in   sealed   envelope,   along   with

relevant documents as per the list in appendix-A, through one of the following agencies only, to
