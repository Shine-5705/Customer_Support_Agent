High Temperature Resistant Phthalonitrile Resins

There are many high temperature thermosetting resins which are currently being utilized
in   aerospace   industry   like   epoxy,   phenolics,   PMRs,   cyanate   esters   and   bis-maleimides   for
structural and specialty applications. These resins have their own limitations and drawbacks as
epoxy and phenolics have poor shelf-life at room temperature and have to be stored at sub-zero
conditions and that to for a limited period.  PMR and bis-maleimides have issues related to their
processability   while   cyanate   ester   are   highly   prone   to   hydrolysis   due   to   presence   of   labile
cyanate functional group (-OCN) although they show good thermal and dielectric properties at
elevated temperature. Epoxy resins are not used for high temperature applications although they
have   good   processability   due   to   flexible   aliphatic   chains   present   in   glycidyl-ether   linkage.
Phenolics and PMR resins also have issues related to toxic volatiles leading to volume shrinkage
so   have   limited   processing   methods   for   fabrication   of   composites.   Aromatic   bismaleimides
although  have   high   temperature   stability   and   high   glass   transition  temperature   but   they   are
difficult   to   process.   Aliphatic   bismaleimides   show   poor   isothermal   properties   at   elevated
temperature due to decomposition of aliphatic backbone. 

DMSRDE,   Kanpur   has   developed   high   char   yield   and   low   dielectric   constant
phthalonitrile   resins   to   overcome   above   concerns   especially   for   continuous   usage   at   high
temperature,  high  glass  transition  temperature.  These  properties  are  inherently due  to  highly
aromatic skeleton of cross-linked network. 

Application of Phthalonitrile Resin
Phthalonitrile resins are potential candidates for applications where it can be used as a matrix
resin for fabrication of composites structures in place of currently used phenolic and epoxy resins
on account  of room temperature storage of monomers, high temperature stability, high glass
transition temperature, low dielectric constant and high char yield of cross-linked polymer. The
resin alone can also be used for ablative coating material for surfaces on account of high char
yield.
