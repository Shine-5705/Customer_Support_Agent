HMX based Pressable High Explosive Compositions (PBXP-202) for Main

Charge (MC) of Tandem Warhead

To make high explosive composition / molding powder  for MC of Tandem

Warhead, slurry methodology was chosen for coating binders on HMX particles.

Slurry   based   method   is   safe   and   MEK   +   water   is   a   conducive   medium   for

coating. A reaction vessel fitted with propeller blades and baffle plates were used

for manufacture of high explosive composition. The reaction vessel is of suitable

capacity and is fitted with a suitable power pack to rotate the agitator. It is also

fitted with cooling and heating arrangements. The other equipments which are

required are water heated oven, electronic weighing balance, filter etc.

The high explosive composition / molding powder (PBXP-202) having lower

sensitivity, high density, high VoD was developed by coating HMX particles with

a   binder   at   high   temperature.  The   high   explosive   composition   is   used   for

manufacture of MC which is based on shaped-charge kill-mechanism to destroy/

damage the targets by penetration and blast effect.  This composition has been

proven to have equivalent performance as that of imported origin. 

Therefore, this technology has fully matured and it is ready for transfer to

any Private Industry and PSU having PESO License. 

All   the   raw   materials,   equipments   and   test   facilities   required   for   the

preparation and characterization of HE composition are indigenously available.  

Application Areas:

HMX  based   Pressable   High   Explosive   Compositions for  MC   of tandem

warhead   is   used   mainly   for   shaped   charge   warhead.   The   HE   composition

including   the   HMX   and   other   binders   destroys   /   damages   the   targets   by   the

penetration and blast effect.

Unique Selling Point (USP):

All   the   developmental   trials   of   composition   have   been   completed

successfully. All the raw materials and equipments required for the preparation of

HE composition are indigenously available.
