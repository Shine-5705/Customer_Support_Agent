HMX based Pressable High Explosive Compositions (PBXP-203) for Precursor (PC) of Tandem

Warhead

This technology includes the processing of  HMX / Wax based Pressable High Explosive

Compositions (PBXP-203) for PC of Tandem Warhead. The High Explosive composition having

characteristics   of   lower   sensitivity,   high   density,   high   VoD   and   pressable   composition   has   been

developed by mixing bimodal HMX with ceresin wax in water based slurry at high temperature. Raw

materials and equipment such as mixers, ovens, and test facilities required for the preparation and

characterization of HE composition are indigenously available.  The HE composition developed using

this   technology   can   be   adopted   for   single   action   pressing   of   shaped   charge   and   similar   type   of

warheads to achieve desired high order penetration with optimized weight. Exhaustive studies have

been   carried   out   to   finalize   the   high   VoD   HE   compositions  and   their   filling   weight   to   realize   the

penetration performance against hard targets.

Static evaluation trials of this composition in pellet form  have been completed successfully.

The ingredients for making this high explosive for warhead of missile are indigenously available. 

Application Areas:

HMX based Pressable High Explosive Compositions using were as binder is used for PC of

Tandem Warhead and is meant to initiates the Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) fitted on Tanks. 

Unique Selling Point (USP):

All   the   developmental   trials  of   composition   have   been   completed   successfully.   All   the   raw

materials and equipments required for the preparation of HE composition are indigenously available.
