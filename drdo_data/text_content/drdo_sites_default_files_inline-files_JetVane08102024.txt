Manufacturing of Carbon-Silicon Carbide composite (C-SiC) Jet Vanes through
Liquid Silicon Infiltration Method

Introduction
Jet vane are used in Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system. At initial stage of launch,
when the velocity is very less, jet vanes are used to control yaw, pitch and roll by
using   high   speed   motor   exhaust.   Exhaust   is   having   very   high   temperature,   high
heating rate, high mass flow rate with solid particle impingement where high mass
flux of the exhaust gases exert very high shear stresses in addition to the chemical/
oxidative  attack which  results into  a severe  thermo-oxidative  recession  of  the Jet
vane.  This   innovation   was   created   to   indigenize   this   critical   system   for   typical
applications.   C-SiC   (Carbon   Fiber   Reinforced   Silicon   Carbide)   Composite   is   a
thermo-structural   material   which   has   high   thermal   shock   resistance,   oxidation
resistance   and   melting   point.   It   can   retain   its   mechanical   strength   at   high
temperature and can be used up to 25000C for short duration.

Essential infrastructure required for ToT
Those who are willing to take up the ToT should have a plant having pitch infiltrator,
Carbonization   furnace,   Graphitization   furnace,   Hot   Iso   static  Pressurization   (HIP)
System, Heat Treatment/ Siliconisation furnace. Approximately 20Cr investment is
required (except HIP).

Areas of application: C-SiC jet vanes are used in thrust vector control system.
