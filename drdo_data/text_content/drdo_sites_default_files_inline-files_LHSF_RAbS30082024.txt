Lightweight High Strength Flexible Radar Absorbing Rubber Sheet 
(LHSF-RAbS)

The Radar reflection of an object is dominated by the radar energy returned from

various   scattering   centers   of   complex   shaped   targets.   The   application   of   Radar

Absorbing   Materials   (RAMs)   to   attenuate   the   back   reflected   radar   energy,   is   an

effective way of reduction of Radar energy. Add-on Radar absorbing materials not

only   have   the   required   functional   properties   of   radar   absorption   at   the   desired

frequency bands, but are also constrained to be thin and to carry minimum weight

penalty   and   meet   the   operational   requirements.   These   add-on   materials   are

developed  in the form of flexible radar absorbing rubber sheets to cover the surface.

DRDO has developed Radar Absorbing Rubber sheet for application on targets to

reduce Radar reflection. The developed rubber sheet is flexible, light weight and has

high strength with wide thermal stability. The functional dielectric filler has been used

in   appropriate   ratio   in   rubber   matrix   to   obtain   maximum   absorption   properties  in

microwave frequency. 

Advantages of Technology:    The developed Radar absorbing   rubber sheet   has

following advantages:

 Exhibit microwave absorption more than 90%



Light weight with Specific gravity

 High Tensile and Tear  strength 

 Temperature thermal stability



less time consuming for covering large area

 Flexible, cut and paste type, easy to apply on curved surface

 Custom molded to any shape

 Resistance to Hydraulic Oil and Water

 Can   be   pasted   on   Al/Al   alloy,   MS   and   CFRP   composite   surface   using

compatible rubber based adhesive 

 Compatible for application of  epoxy based color coating  on surface of sheet 



capable for outdoor application on airborne, land and sea  based  targets.
