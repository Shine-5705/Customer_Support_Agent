Laser Photo Acoustic Spectroscopy (LPAS) 

the  detection  of  explosives  and  other  hazardous 
In  present  day  scenario, 
substances/materials  used  by  Anti-National  Elements  (ANEs)  is  very  difficult  and 

tedious  in  nature.  The  ANEs  carry  these  materials  either  in  very  small  quantity 
packaged in a manner to which  are visually difficult to detect and do not  emanate any 

vapours.   

Instruments  Research  &  Development  Establishment  (IRDE)  has  developed  LPAS 

technology that has the capability of detection and identification of hazardous molecules 
(vapour/aerosols/liquid/powder)  from  a  stand-off  distance,  which  get  adsorbed  on  the 

surface  of  packaging  material,  clothes,  baggage,  parcels  etc.  during  the  packaging 
process. It may also be configured for point detection application for trace detection of 

residues of hazardous molecules on surface of bags, clothes, briefcases etc. 

Interested  Industries  are  requested  to  forward  their  Expression  of  Interest  (EoI)  with 
supporting  documents  as  per  Appendix  ‘D’  of  DRDO  Policy  and  Procedure  for  ToT
