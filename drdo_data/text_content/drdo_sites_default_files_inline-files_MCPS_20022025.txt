Military Combat Parachute System 

ADRDE  has  developed  ‘Military  Combat  Parachute  System  (MCPS)’  as  per  JSQR  No:  1670-1 
(revised  in  2022)  for  the  Tri  Services  and  Special  Frontier  Force.  Military  Combat  Parachute 
System (MCPS) is a mode of insertion used by SF to penetrate paratroopers with combat load 
into  designated  area  of  operations.    MCPS  allows  Paratroopers  to  jump  from  an  aircraft  and 
deploy  their  Parachutes  at  pre-determined  Altitude,  Navigate  and  Land  Safely.  MCPS  system 
can be used in High Altitude High Opening (HAHO), High Altitude Medium Opening (HAMO) & 
High-Altitude Low Opening (HALO) modes as required for the particular scenario. The parachute 
system  has  been  designed  as  per  international  standard  and  qualification  test  schedule  (QTS) 
has been prepared in line with Parachute Industry Association (PIA) and approved by Centre for 
Military  Airworthiness  and  Certification  (CEMILAC).  Accordingly,  various  qualification  of  system 
was carried out. Based on CEMILAC has accorded the certification of various system of MCPS.
