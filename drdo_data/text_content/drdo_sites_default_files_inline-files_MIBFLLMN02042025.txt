Multifunctional Insecticidal Bi-component Filament for Long Lasting Mosquito

Net

Insecticide-loaded textile articles are used to provide protection against vector borne
diseases.  This technology describes  a method for making insecticide-incorporated
filaments   having   long   lasting   efficiency   against   vector   protection.  Pyrethroids,   a
family of insecticides that includes permethrin, alpha-cypermethrin and deltamethrin
(DM)  are highly  effective in killing mosquitoes, by disabling their nervous systems.
WHO sanctioned the use of selected set of these pyrethroids. DM has a much longer
duration   as   well   as   stronger   insecticidal   activity   than   other   commonly  available
insecticides;   therefore,   the   doses   needed   for   protection   against   mosquitoes  are
extremely low. So, it is efficiently economical. DM is also advantageous because its
activity persists over a wide range of temperature. 

Various   insecticide   formulation-containing   binders   have   been   used   to   impart
insecticidal   efficiency   on   knitted   fabric   by   exhaust/pad   method.  However,   these
fabrics could not sustain their insecticidal efficacy after repeated laundry washes. In
order to achieve durability, insecticides have been incorporated into polymer matrix
prior  to   melt   spinning.  Incorporation  of   insecticide   into  textile  articles  also   has  its
regulation limit, and if insecticide has been incorporated only into surface of filament
instead of entire cross-section then enhanced insecticidal efficiency will be resulted. 

We   initiated   bi-component  filament-spinning   route   having   sheath-core   structure
where insecticide is in the sheath only. 

DRDO has developed insecticidal filaments successfully having 100% mortality up to
20   wash   cycles   for   long-lasting   effect,   incorporating   insecticide   in   the   yarn.  The
developed   yarn   shows   adequate   tenacity  and   elongation.  The   insecticide-
incorporated  knitted fabric also possesses excellent bursting strength. Thus, the bi-
component   melt-spinning 
technique   can   be   effectively   used   to   manufacture
insecticide-incorporated   filaments  having   long-lasting   efficacy   that   can   be   further
converted   into   various   textile  stores   such   as   long-lasting   insecticidal   net,   tents,
shelters and curtains.
