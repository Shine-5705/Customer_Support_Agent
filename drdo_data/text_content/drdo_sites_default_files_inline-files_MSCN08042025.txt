Mounting  and  Support  Equipment  for  Multi  Spectral  Camouflage  Net 
(MSCN) 

Mounting  and  Support  Equipment  for  MSCN  is  developed  for  mounting/erection  of  MSCN 

on  defence  systems  and  equipment  to  disrupt  their  geometry  &  contour  and  providing  desired 

camouflage  cover.  The  product  is  designed  and  developed  for  the  required  high  speed  wind, 

other  static  loading  and  camouflage  features  to  support  MSCN. 

» 

The  equipment  consists  of  a  collapsible,  telescopic  pole.  The  Minimum  or  closed 

height  is 

1  m  and  Maximum  or  Open  height  is  5  m.  There  is  provision  of  varying  the 

Pole’s  height  ranging  from  1  m  to  5  m  with  25  cm  increments. 

» 

The  equipment  is  made  up  of  high  strength  Aluminium  Alloy  tubing  which  offers 

high  strength  and  light  weight. 

» 

The  equipment’s  top  is  designed  for  easy  entanglement  of  net  so  that  net  doesn’t  slip 

at  the  same  time  preventing  the  net  from  tearing  due  to  penetrations/indentation. 

» 

The  crimped  bottom  can  easily  fit  into  any  terrain  base  providing  stability  at  high 

speed  wind  loading. 

» 

Erection  time  of  an  MSCN  with  these  poles  (8-10  Nos.)  is 

less  than  10  min. 

Alignment  marking  is  done  for  smooth  and  fast  opening  with  quarter  turn  locking 

pins. 

» 

The  gloss  less  finish  in  olive  green/beige/white  colour  (given  by  anodizing/powder 

coating)  makes  the  equipment  visual  camouflage  even  during  transport/in  non- 

erected  condition. 

» 

Robust  design  and  Corrosion  less  MOC  performs  well  in  extreme  service  condition 

(-50  °C  to  +  70  °C)  which  makes  it  suitable  for  using  in  all  terrain  and  all  weather 

condition. 

» 

Twisted  Pin  made  up  of  MS  for  anchoring  the  net  is  also  a  part  of  Mounting  and 

Support  Equipment.  The  twisted  pins  are  Zn  coated  and  then  chromate  passivated. 

Application:  For  Erection,  Support  and  Mounting  of  Camouflage  Nets  (MSCN/  SCN  etc.)  to 

Camouflage  the  Defence  Equipment  and  Systems.
