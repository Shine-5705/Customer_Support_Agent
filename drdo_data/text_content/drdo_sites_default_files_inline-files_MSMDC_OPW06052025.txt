Manufacturing of Shaped Miniature Detonating Cord 

The Canopy Fragmentation system is part of emergency escape system of aircraft in a two seater 
aircraft  and  thus  each  cockpit  has  its  independent  fragmentation  system.  It  uses  the  shaped 
Miniature  Detonating  Cord  (SMDC)  fixed  on  the  transparency  as  well  as  periphery  to  shatter  the 
canopy bubble during ejection. Suitable initiation system is activated by pilot during emergency for 
safe ejection. 

HEMRL  has  developed  the  technology  for SMDC  for use  in  pilot ejection  system.  SMDC  is in  the 
form of a continuous explosive filled cord and is fixed by means of adhesive to the inner surface of 
canopy transparency. The cord is led from the initiator assembly around both the periphery of the 
transparency  and  also  to  form  an  overhead  pattern.  Suitable  protection  is provided  for  the  SMDC 
using  attenuator  material  to  reduce  the  shock  wave.  The  pattern  of  SMDC  on  the  canopy 
transparency  is  designated  to  achieve  fragilisation  of  canopy  for  safe  ejection  of  pilot.  The 
technology of SMDC is available for manufacturing of SMDC.
