Omni-directional Multi-EFP Warhead for Naval Anti-Ship Missile-
Short Range (NASM-SR) 

            DRDO has developed a helicopter launched air to surface weapon system
to meet the anti-surface warfare requirements of Indian Navy. 
An   Omni-directional   Multi-EFP   technology   based   Penetration   Cum   Blast   (PCB)
warhead (except fuze) is designed. The warhead would penetrate target due to its
kinetic   energy   and   then   it   shall   explode   with   in   few   milli   seconds   to   generate
fragments  and blast  sufficient enough  to  put  the  target/vessel out  of  action. The
warhead   casing   will  be   filled   with   suitable   high   explosive.   Blast  and   penetration
performance evaluation trials of warhead in standalone and integrated mode have
been completed. 

Omni-directional Multi-EFP warhead
