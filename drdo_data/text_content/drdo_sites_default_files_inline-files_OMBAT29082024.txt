24m  Mountain  Bridge  for  ATV 

As  further  development  of  the  35m  Mountain  Foot  Bridge  developed  by  R&DE(E),  Pune  a 

manually  launched  light  weight  Mountain  Bridge  for  All  Terrain  Vehicle  (ATV)  of  Gross  Vehicle 

Weight  1Ton  of  total  length  24m  with  a  pathway  of  1.8  m  has  now  been  developed.  The  bridge  is 

made  of  high-strength  aluminum  alloy  components  such  that  each  component  is  man-portable.  It 

includes  a  launching  system  that  facilitates  the  bridge  to  be  launched  from  near-bank  without  any 

access  to  the  far-bank.  ToT  of  this  technology  requires  industries  to  have  taken  the  ToT  of  35m 

Mountain  Foot  Bridge. 

The  system  is  made  compact  considering  limited  availability  of  back  space  during  launching  in 

mountain  regions.  The  joints  of  the  bridge  facilitate  easy  assembly  in  field  conditions.  The  system 

is  modular  and  comprises  mainly  triangular  panels,  top  bars  and  deck  units.  24  m  bridge  can  be 

launched  in  about  150  minutes  with  a  crew  of  15  plus  commander.  The  time  of  launch  will  reduce 

proportionately  for  shorter  soans.  The  Bridge  can  be  used  for  personnel  and  ATVs  of  GVW  up  to 

1000  kg. 

Features 

Max  bridge  length  —  24m  with  width  of  1.8m. 

Modular  construction  for  facilitating  variable  spans. 

Use  of  high  strength  aluminium  alloy  for  light  weight 

Back  space  of  15m  x  8m  for  24m  &  less  for  short  span. 

Manually  launched  with  a  crew  of  15  plus  commander  within  150  minutes 

Minimum  head  room  available  on  the  bridge  -  2.1  m 

Bridging  components  weighing  <  18  kg 

Transportation  -  Man  portable,  using  in  service  2.5  /  5  /  7.5  t  vehicle(s)
