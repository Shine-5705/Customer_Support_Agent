 Technology for Production of High Explosive Composition and its filling in 40mm x 

46mm HEAP & HEDP Grenades for UBGL/ MGL 

Description of Technology: 

Two  types  of  40  mm  Grenade  ammunitions  namely  HEAP  and  HEDP  are  required  to 

destroy  targets  using  kill  mechanisms  viz  armour  penetration  and  blast  &  fragmentation 

respectively.  To  achieve  respective  QRs  (The  pressed  composition  PBXPW-2  developed 

possesses  VOD  of  8200  m/s  and  density  of  1.64  g/cc  for  HEAP  grenade  and  the  pressed 

composition PBXPW-3 developed for HEDP grenade possesses VOD of 8400 m/s and density 

of 1.68 g/cc), high explosive compositions and their filling methodology in  these ammunitions 

have  been  designed  and  developed  by  DRDO.  The  high  explosive  system  in  both  the 

ammunitions  consists  of  main  charge  and  booster.  Main  charge  consists  of  RDX  based  HE 

composition in case of HEAP and HMX based in case of HEDP. Booster is based on PETN in 

both cases. 

HE compositions and their filling methodologies in these munitions have been finalized 

to realize the performance lethality at the given distances in terms of blast, fragmentation and 

penetration  in  MS  targets  respectively.  The  pressing  technology  has  been  developed  for  the 

main charges of the ammunitions and for boosters.  Present ToT is for both the ammunitions 

namely HEAP (PBXPW-2) and HEDP (PBXPW-3).  

All  the  development  activities  such  as  establishment  of  high  explosive  preparation 

technology,  filling  methodologies,  all  the  performance  evaluation  trials,  dynamic trials  of  both 

the ammunitions have been fully completed meeting all the QRs.  

All the raw materials and equipment required are available indigenously.
