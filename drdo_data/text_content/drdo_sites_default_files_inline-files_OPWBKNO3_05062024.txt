Manufacturing of BKNO3 Pellets of ME-445 Composition

Pyrotechnic Igniters are used for ignition of solid rocket propellants. Igniters provide the heat
flux to propellant surface for reliable ignition. Also, it provides certain minimum pressure in the
rocket motor chamber for sustained combustion. High heat output igniters compositions based
on B/KNO3    have been developed and the composition is used in No. of igniters for rocket
motors. Igniter compositions is prepared  by mixing fuel, oxidizer and binder in the planetary
mixer. After mixing, composition is granulated for easy loading and homogeneity. Granulated
composition is used for pelleting. Igniterâ€™s compositions in the form of granules or pellets is
filled in the canister of aluminum alloy or steel and used as igniter.
