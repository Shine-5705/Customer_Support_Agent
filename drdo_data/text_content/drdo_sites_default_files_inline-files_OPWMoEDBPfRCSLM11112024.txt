Manufacturing of EDB Propellant for RCS & LM 

1. 

HEMRL has developed extruded Double base (EDB) propellant to meet the requirement of:- 

(a)   RCS-32 Nos of RCS motors are used during initial phase of flight launch from tube to 
provide  any  corrections  in  Role,  Pitch  and  Yaw  control  after  the  missile  achieves  its 
desired velocity at which aerodynamics controls surface becomes effective. 

(b)   LM-  A  cluster  of  25  grains  is  designed  for  Launch  Motor  configuration.  LM  is  used  to 

eject the missile from launch tube. 

A unique combination of ballistic modifiers and processing methodology was used to achieve 
the burn rate and desired ballistic properties. 

2. 

NC-NG  based  high  burn  rate  EDB  propellant  combination  was  developed  for  RCS  &  LM  in 
order  to  meet  the  required  pressure  time  &  thrust  time  profile.  Processing  and  validation 
method of EDB Propellant for RCS & LM is different from regular EDB Propellant Processing 
technology. 

3. 

EDB Propellant for need to meet following requirements:- 

(i)  

Burn rate at 90Kg/ cm2 pressure for 

(a)   RCS- 22.5±1.0 mm/s. 

(ii) 

(iii) 

(iv) 

LM- 24.60±1.5 mm/s. 

(b) 
High mechanical properties (UTS>100kg/cm2) suitable for free standing grain 

Smokeless exhaust. 

Low pressure exponent values in high pressure range (<0.3 in pressure range of 70-190 
kg/cm2).  

(v) 

Suitable for operation in temperature range of -30ºC to +55ºC. 

4. 

EDB  Propellant  processing  technology  has  been  fully  established  and  validated  in  static  and 
flight  trials.  All  the  development  activities  such  as  establishment  of  Double  Base  EDB 
Propellant  combination,  processing  technology,  ballistic  performance  evaluation  trials  and 
dynamic flight trials have been successfully completed. All the QRs were met in the trials. 

Development technology is at par with globally available technology. All the raw materials and 
equipment required for processing of EDB Propellant for RCS & LM are available indigenously. 
RCS  and  LM  propellant  manufacturing  technology  is  now  mature  and  ready  for  Transfer  of 
industry.
