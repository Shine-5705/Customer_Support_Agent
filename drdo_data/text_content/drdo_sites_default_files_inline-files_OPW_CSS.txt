           Canopy Severance System (CSS)

Canopy Severance System (CSS) is part of the pilot’s escape aid system in aircraft. It is
designed  to   rescue  the  pilot  in   shortest  possible   time   during   in-flight  and   on-ground
emergencies in combat aircrafts. The development is based on ejection through Canopy
Severance   System   instead   of   Canopy   Jettisoning   method,   which   has   a   major
shortcoming of consuming vital  time required  for safe escape  ejection  of pilots from
endangered aircraft.  

Dual In-flight Egress system is operated by the pilot in case of emergencies occurring

while the aircraft is in flight. In the other systems, during emergency, when the pilot

pulled   the   Seat   Ejection   handle,   the   series   of   operations,   entailed   more   than   1400

milliseconds. By the use of Canopy Severance System, the time to sever the Canopy is

reduced to merely 20 milliseconds, thus giving a clean cut on the canopy, providing a

safe passage to the Pilot and the Seat to eject safely. A portion of gas pressure is

tapped from the Seat Ejection initiation gas pressure which is fed into the Pressure

Actuated Initiator (PAI). Thus PAI is actuated and a detonation wave is developed which

travels   through   Explosive   Transfer   Lines   (ETLs),   Junction   Boxes   and   finally   to   the

Shaped Miniature Detonating Cord which cuts the Acrylic bubble of the Canopy linearly

near the centre line and thus weakens it. The pieces of the weakened acrylic will be

thrown away by the movement of the seat. This will provide the path through which seat

and pilot can eject safely.

Technologies Involved

The following technologies are involved

 Controlled propagation of detonation wave. 
 Preparation of explosive cord.
 Testing & Proof Methodology of explosive systems.
 Cutting of target material using optimized explosive charges.
 Mfg technologies for explosive lines & hardware.
