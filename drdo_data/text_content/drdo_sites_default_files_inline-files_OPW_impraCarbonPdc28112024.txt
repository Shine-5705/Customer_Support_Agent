REFURBISHMENT OF SPENT PALLADIUM IMPREGNATED CARBON (Pd/C)

The  present technology  pertains to the  development  of  a cost effective  and
scalable   process   for   Palladium   (Pd)   metal   recovery   from   spent   palladium
impregnated carbon (Pd/C) cartridges used by Indian Navy for the oxidative removal
of carbon monoxide. The Pd/C cartridges contain Pd which makes it expensive. In an
endeavor to explore alternate strategies, studies were undertaken in laboratory to
identify simple, cost effective and a scalable technique that can be easily adopted by
industries for Pd recovery and reuse of the recovered metal for various applications.
The   extraction   of   palladium   from   Pd   impregnated   activated   carbon   has   been
conducted using different extraction routes at a laboratory scale. This has led to the
efficient extraction of Pd from spent Pd/C with ~96% recovery. This would directly
impact the cost of the cartridges as Pd can be recovered and reused. This technology
is anticipated to have dual benefits. Firstly, recovery and reuse of spent Pd/C filter
cartridges will lead to a savings of a minimum of 40% compared to procurement of
fresh   Pd/C   filters.   Secondly,   waste   management   of   the   expended/   used   filters
containing metals, including precious metals such as Palladium will be efficient. The
carbon support after metal removal is environmentally benign and easy to dispose. 
The refurbishment process of the used filter materials broadly involves three steps:

i) Recovery/ Extraction of Palladium (Pd) from used filter cartridges 
ii) Functionalization of fresh Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)
iii) Impregnation of extracted Pd onto fresh GAC
iv) Reduction of impregnated Pd salt using suitable reducing agent
The   raw   materials   include   used  Palladium   Impregnated   Granular   Activated
Carbon obtained from naval services, fresh Granular Activated Carbon (GAC). Other
chemicals   like   mineral   acids   such   as   nitric   acid,   hydrochloric   acid,   alkali   such   as
sodium   hydroxide   and   suitable   reducing   agent   like   formaldehyde   can   be   sourced
from chemical suppliers.

The   industry   partner/   ToT   holders   having   existing   ToT   for   the   Air   Cleaning
Filters with the infrastructure such as mixers, dryers, suitable lab wares, and reactors
for scale-up and bulk production are ideally suited for the ToT of refurbishment of
Pd/C filters. However, new industry partners with experience in manufacturing metal
impregnated   granular   activated   carbon   (GAC)   such   as   Pd,   Pt   etc   and   having   the
above   infrastructure   for   scale-up   can   also   take   the   ToT.  Refurbished   filter   should
qualify as per laid down accepted test procedures (ATP).

Salient features:

• Palladium impregnated activated carbon developed from used Pd/C filters
• Technology reuses already impregnated Palladium metal
• Extraction   method   using   various   acid-based   routes   may   be   employed   and

subsequent re-impregnation on fresh activated carbon
