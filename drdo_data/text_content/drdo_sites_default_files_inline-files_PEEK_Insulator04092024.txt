PEEK Lightning Insulator Pipes (5 Types)

Lightning insulator pipes are to be used for the protection of LCA (Tejas) from lightning effect. The
basic   polymeric   material   used   for   such   items   is   desired   to   meet   the   stringent   functional
requirements.  Lightning insulator  pipes are  integral  part of  fuel pipeline systems  of the aircraft
which have been developed by DMSRDE.

Figure: PEEK Lightning insulator pipes for LCA-Mk-1 (Tejas)

The lightning insulator pipes are made of high performance polymer, poly (polyether ether ketone)
and obtained in injection moulding process.  Lightning insulator pipes (5 types) are developed by
DMSRDE and are used to protect aircraft against lightning effect.
