 “Piezoceremic Micro-Spherical Transducer Elements” 

Systems utilizing mechanical pressure waves are popular for underwater applications.  PZT based 

piezoelectric  materials  are  excellent  underwater  electro-mechanical  energy  converters.  Hence 

PZT based piezoelectric materials form the heart of any kind of underwater transducer system.   

Obtaining  high  resolution  underwater  image  is  achievable  at  higher  frequencies  which  demand 

size  miniaturization  of  the  piezo-components.  Piezoceramic  hollow  spherical  micro-transducer 

elements are required for development of high frequency (> 300 kHz) hydrophone for underwater 

transducer applications. ToT will comprise of method to manufacture sensitive electro-ceramic viz, 

PNS-PZT composition and fabricating micro-spherical transducers out of that.
