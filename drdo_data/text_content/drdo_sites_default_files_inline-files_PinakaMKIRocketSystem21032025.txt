(i) ESR grade preform

(ii) Flow formed motor tube

(iii) Silica phenolic lining

(iv) Wrap around fin assembly

(v) Convergent – Divergent Nozzle assembly

(vi) Solid composite rocket propellant

(vii) Cartridge loaded propulsion system with pressure equalisation

(viii) Composite warhead hardware casing

(ix) TA spheres as preformed fragments

(x) Practice warhead

(xii) FRP launcher tube

(xii) Strength Light Weight Aluminium Alloy Pod assembly
