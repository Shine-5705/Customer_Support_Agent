T  hermoplastic Ester Polyurethane (Instance): Process technology

Instane   is   a   class   of   theremoplastic   Ester   polyurethane.   This   polymer   possesses   a
combination   of   attractive   properties   like   high   elongation   and   tensile   strength,   high
toughness, excellent abrasion, and tears resistance. Instane is a segmented thermoplastic
polyurethane elastomer with non-looming characteristics and it can be considered as multi-
block   copolymers,   These   are   melt-processed   and   used   in   a   wide   range   of   product
applications and finds great applications in defence as well as in civil use.

In defence  application, it is a  vital component for the development of pressable  plastic
bonded   explosive   (PBXs)   compositions   that   provide   excellent   mechanical   properties.
Specifically, the developed theremoplastic polyurethane elastomer has potential application
as binder in various pressable formulations for country’s major defence programmes.

In the civil sector, this polymer can also widely be used in formation of fibres, prosthetic
limbs, surface coating, core of golf balls and many others. This technology is not security
sensitivity technology  and have large commercial potential beyond Defense use.

Currently, in the defence sector, huge requirement of the same has been anticipated for
the development of warheads of ongoing  missile programmes. At present, the requirement
has been estimated to be about 100kg per annum. Thus, the in-house R&D efforts have
been made to realize this product and the process has been established at 1kg/batch on
product   basis.   The   developed   product   has   been   rigorously   tested   in   the   current
formulations  as  import   substitute.   The   product   (instane)  met   all   quality  requirements  of
pressable compositions. Considering the demand, non-explosive nature and also its use in
civil sector, TOT on process technology of thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer has been
initiated.

The developed strategic polymer has dual use as it will find application in defence and as
well as commercial sector. The spin-off technologies are not security sensitive technologies
and   have   large   commercial   potential   beyond   Defence   Use.   This   material   is   useful   to
manufacture the products in India/abroad and sell products in India and /or abroad and
non-exclusive basis to industry.
