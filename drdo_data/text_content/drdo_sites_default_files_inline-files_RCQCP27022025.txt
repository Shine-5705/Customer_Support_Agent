RFSoC based Controller of Quantum Computer Processor (RCQCP)

Background

RFSoC based Controller of Quantum Computer Processor (RCQCP) allows control and
measurement of quantum states of upto 8 qubits. It is based on the Xilinx (AMD) ZCU
216   RFSoC   development   board.   Control   waveforms   for   characterisation   and
subsequent quantum programs may be written using Qiskit toolboxes. The results of
measurement   are   available   as   raw   In-Phase   and   Quadrature-Phase   (IQ)   data   i.e.
processed ADC samples, as ensemble average data and as logical data as per user
requirement. All channels are subject to simultaneous measurement.

The   system   is   specially   targeted   for   qubits   based   on   super-conducting   circuits   with
control frequencies in the range of 4-5 GHz and readout frequencies in the range of 7-8
GHz. The signal generation relies on both first and second Nyquist zone and readout is
performed using aliased signals with proper frequency planning.

Cavity   spectroscopy,   qubit   spectroscopy   and   subsequent   characterisation   like   Rabi,
Ramsey, T1 decoherence and T2 decoherence, etc. can be performed using this single
board solution.  

Features

 8 Qubit control and measurement considering each qubit requires:

o Control channel to qubit, 
o Read-out pulse channel to cavity, 
o Read-out pulse channel from cavity.

 Qubit Control frequency range: 4-5 GHz
 Qubit Read-out frequency range: 7-8 GHz
 Max Instantaneous BW at Intermediate Frequency (IF): 307.2 MSPS per channel
 Sequence Size / No. of Circuits: 600 @ 200 usec circuit window (user 

configurable)

 Shots: User configurable
 Streaming mode data acquisition for RF channel characterisation
 Custom Baseband Filter Update
 Qiskit based API

Scope of Usage

RCQCP will enable a cost-effective solution to control and measure qubits in a quantum
processor while allowing for easy scale-up of such systems at moderate increment of
power budget. Therefore, it is expected to make quantum computing accessible to a
wider audience in academia, industry and the scientific community.
