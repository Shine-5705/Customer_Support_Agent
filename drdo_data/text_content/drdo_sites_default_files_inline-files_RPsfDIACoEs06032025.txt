Integrated Avionics  

Brief of the Research Problem  
Integrated  Modular  Avionics  (IMA)  is  the  need  of  the  hour  to  build  SWaP  (Size,  Weight,  and 
Power)  optimized  avionics  for  aircrafts.  Availability  of  reliable  COTS  hardware  with  multi  core  or 
multi  processors  enables  deployment  of  multiple  avionics  applications  such  as  navigation,  flight 
control,  weapon/payload  management,  ground  communication,  etc.  in  a  single  box.  However, 
achieving safe separation (both spatial and temporal) among different applications and meeting the 
safety and certification requirements poses a big challenge. Though COTS hypervisors and multi-
core Operating Systems are available, they are of foreign origin, heavy weight and opaque. Hence, 
the need for an indigenously developed light weight multi-core OS which can be used for various 
avionics applications for manned and unmanned aircrafts.  

Major Objectives

Indigenous,  light  weight  multi-core  and  multiprocessor  OS  complying  to  DO-297  and  ARINC 
653 guidelines

  Provisions for monitoring of health and resource usage of applications  
  Provision to restart a failed application through checkpoints or other mechanism

IO, messages, etc)  

  Framework  for  developing  the  BSP  (Board  Support  Package)  and  porting  the  OS  to  various 
hardware (at least Power PC and ARM architecture to be supported at the time of completion)

Automated material classification using a combination 
of spatial & textural features and generation of Multi-
Sensor  Data  Fusion  (MSDF)  at  pixel/data/decision 
level  using  High  (sub-meter)  Resolution  Satellite 
Imagery for Imaging Sensor scene creation  

Technology Area 
Hardware In Loop Simulation  

Technology Category 
Flight Simulation  

Brief of the Research Problem  
Flight Simulators require high fidelity & detailed large gaming areas of the order of 500km X 500 
km or more, typically centered around an airfield. Currently available COTS tool have technology 
for material classification that are based on pixel colour of the satellite imagery used. However, the 
technology  to  make  use  of  inherent  textural  features  (like  energy,  entropy,  contrast  etc.)  for 
material  classification  is  currently  not  available.  In  addition  to  creation  of  visual  scenes,  it  is  also 
required to create correlated imaging sensor scenes like EO/IR & Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) 
scenes that are available to the pilots/operators training in the Flight Simulators. With advances in 
AI and fast image processing algorithms for generation of textural features, it is very much possible 
to extract such features for the entire large gaming area with minimal interaction on the part of the 
human  operator.  It  is  proposed  to  automatically  classify  the  gaming  area  into  different  materials, 
using  a  combination  of  colour  and  textural  features  derived  from  the  satellite  imagery.  With  the 
usage of Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF) in various airborne systems there is a requirement to 
simulate the same in Flight Simulators to effectively train the users (Pilots/Sensor Operator) on the 
utilization  of  MSDF.  Hence,  it  is  also  proposed  to  generate  fused  outputs  of  optical  and  imaging 
sensor  views  to  generate  MSDF  outputs  by  using  a  suitable  weighing/combination  of  input  data. 
The implementation can also provide a basis for comparing MSDF outputs generated at different 
levels (pixel/data/decision levels). The material classified and synthetically created MSDF outputs 
can  be  integrated  with  visual  &  sensor  scenes  using  in  Flight  Simulators  for  more  accurate  and 
effective training.  

Major Objectives  
  Automatic  classification  of  the  gaming  area  into  different  materials,  using  a  combination  of 

colour and textural features derived from the satellite imagery  

  Generation  of  fused  outputs  from  optical  and  imaging  sensor  views  to  generate  Multi-Sensor 
Data Fusion (MSDF) outputs by using a suitable weighing/combination of the input scenes  

Expected Deliverables 
  Algorithms  for  Automatic  classification  of  the  gaming  area  into  different  materials,  using  a 
combination  of  colour  and  textural  features  derived  from  the  satellite  imagery,  for  usage  in 
Flight Simulators  

  Algorithms for Generation of fused outputs from optical and imaging sensor views to generate 
Multi-Sensor  Data  Fusion  (MSDF)  outputs  by  using  a  suitable  weighing/combination  of  the 
input scenes for usage in Flight Simulators

Automated  Extraction  of  3D 
features  (like 
tracks)  using  a 
buildings,  bridges,  metro 
combination  of  High  (sub-meter)  Resolution 
Mono/Stereo  Satellite  Imagery  &  DEM  Data  for 
Visual & Imaging Sensor scene creation  

Technology Area 
Hardware In Loop Simulation  

Technology Category 
Flight Simulation  

Brief of the Research Problem  
Flight Simulators require high fidelity and detailed large gaming areas of the order of 500km X 500 
km  or  more,  typically  centered  around  an  airfield.  Current  technologies  involve  manual  &  semi-
automated  creation  of  densely  populated  3D  structures  in  urban  areas  around  the  airfield  and 
creation of additional structures based on end-user requirement only in specific areas. Creation of 
a  visual  scene  takes  anywhere  between  three  months  to  one  year  based  on  the  amount  of 
detailing  and  fidelity  expected  by  the  end-user.  With  requirement  for  high  fidelity  simulators  for 
practicing  missions  in  a  variety  of  terrain  and  geographic  locations  coming  up  at  a  fast  pace,  it 
would  be  prudent  to  automate  this  process.  With  the  advances  in  AI,  computing  power  &  image 
processing  algorithms,  it  is  very  much  possible  to  extract  3D features for  the entire  large  gaming 
area  with  only  minimal  interaction  on the part  of  the  human  developer/operator. It  is proposed  to 
automatically  extract  various  3D-structures  like  buildings,  bridges  &  metro  tracks  using  a 
combination of High resolution Mono/Stereo Satellite Imagery & DEM data. While Satellite Imagery 
can  provide  the  spatial  details,  the  information  from  shadows,  meta-data  from  the  satellite 
capturing  the  image,  triangulation  based  on  stereo  imagery  and  Digital  Elevation  Model  (DEM) 
data can provide the required height information of the 3D structures. The problem can be broken 
down into two parts:  
  Part  1)  Automated  Creation  of  a  Vector  Map  (information  in  points,  lines,  polygons)  using 

Artificial Intelligence  

  Part 2) Conversion of this vector information into an extruded 3D model/scene using AI making 

use of the information embedded in the vector map generated in Part 1.  

Major Objectives  
Automatic  extraction  of  various  3D-structures  like  buildings,  bridges  &  metro  tracks  using  a 
combination of High resolution Mono/Stereo Satellite Imagery & DEM data
