DESIGN OF CABINET WITH ACCESSORIES FOR SOILLESS CULTIVATION 

OF MICROGREENS IN COLD AND HIGH ALTITUDE REGIONS 

India shares border with neighbouring nations in Ladakh which has significant strategic 

importance.  Military  deployment  is  heavily  concentrated  in  this  region.  In  high  altitude 

conditions; production and local availability of fresh food is very limited due to unfavourable & 

short agriculture season. Also, the region remains isolated due to heavy snow and landslides. 

Some posts situated at mountain peaks remain inaccessible for in ordinate durations and they 

are mainly dependent on tinned food. Due to rarefied atmospheric conditions of high altitudes, 

the oxygen availability is low which affects digestion of high calorific food.  Canned food also 

lead to monotonous state of taste due to protracted use and is not optimum for good health. In 

this situation, availability of microgreens as a beneficial food supplement can play a significant 

role  in  providing  essential  minerals,  vitamins,  antioxidants  and  dietary  fibers  along  with 

diversed  taste.  This  nutrient-rich  fresh  green  food  would  maintain  health  and  optimal 

operational  performance  in  troops.  Presence  of  various  phyto-nutrients  in  the  microgreens 

makes it highly beneficial for soldiers deployed at high altitudes where fresh food availability is 

limited. 

Microgreens are tiny green plants that can be cultivated in 8-10 days.  Self-growing of these 

plants in the barracks/bunkers can help to maintain the physical as well as the mental health 

of  the  troops  in  monotonous  conditions.  After  intensive  R&D  at  DIHAR-DRDO  a  “design  of 

cabinet with accessories for soilless cultivation of microgreens” has been developed in which 

optimal  growing  conditions  for  microgreens  can  be  maintained  by  the  troops  in  their 

bunkers/barracks.  Several features  were  considered  in  developing  the  design  of  the  cabinet 

including  temperature,  humidity,  light,  weight,  durability,  materials  and  ease  of  delivery  to 

forward  positions.  The  dimensions  of  the  design  are  suitable  for  placement  inside  bunkers. 

Accessories  like  trays,  growing  media  and  seeds  have  also  been  designated  for  successful 

cultivation  of  microgreens.  Seeds  struggle  to  germinate  below  10°C;  low  light  and  high 

humidity  weakens  seedling  vigour.  However,  the  cabinet  structure  maintains  optimal 

environmental conditions  crucial for achieving both high quality and quantity of microgreens. 

Drawings  of  the  design  of  cabinet  with  detail  of  accessories  for  growing  microgreen  will  be 

provided under the ToT.
