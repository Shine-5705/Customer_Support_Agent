Vacuum Investment Casting Process for Manufacturing of Equiaxed Ni-based Superalloy
Components of Small Turbo-Fan Engine (STFE)

Description of Technology

Nickel-base superalloy parts such as blades, vanes and rotors are used in hot sections of
aero   gas   turbine   engines.   Currently,   one   of   the   DRDO   laboratories   (GTRE,   Bengaluru)   is
developing a Small Turbo-Fan aero-engine (STFE), which will be used for a variety of strategic
applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles. The hot sections of this engine requires seven
types  of  critical  equiaxed  Ni-base superalloy  components,  namely (i) High Pressure  Turbine
(HPT) blades, (ii) HPT Nozzle Guide Vane (HPTNGV) - Outer Casing, (iii) HPTNGV – Inner
Casing, (iv) HPTNGV- Vane Aerofoil, (v) Pyro-duct Starting Nozzle, (vi) Low Pressure Turbine
Rotor (LPTR) Blisk and (vii) Low Pressure Nozzle Guided Vane (LPNGV). These components
are   shown   in   Fig.1   below.   These   components   are   of   aeronautical   grade   and   are   fabricated
through vacuum investment casting method. Four components (HPT blade, HPTNGV - Outer
Casing, HPTNGV - Inner Casing and LPTR Blisk) do not require ceramic cores. The other three
components (HPTNGV-Vane Aerofoil, Pyro-duct Starting Nozzle and LPNGV) are hollow and
require the use of ceramic cores.

DMRL   has   established   the   vacuum   investment   casting   technology   including   the
manufacturing of ceramic cores to realize the above mentioned seven components of STFE and
has  supplied   them   in limited  numbers  to  the  user.   The  supplied   castings   have   already  been
utilized   by  the   user   agency  successfully.   The  above  casting   technology   is   being  offered  for
transfer to a production agency for bulk production of the components.

The casting technology developed at DMRL has the following constituents for realization of all
seven components:

a) Design of wax pattern dies from component drawings using indigenous sources
b) Process for producing the required ceramic cores (for the hollow components)
c) Ceramic shell making process
d) Casting process using vacuum induction melting
e) Post-casting  processes   including  ceramic  core  removal   by  chemical   leaching  and

non-destructive and destructive examinations.

f) Dimensional measurements by coordinate measuring machine (CMM)
g) Acceptance and inspection procedure of the components

Therefore, the transfer of the casting technology will include all the above aspects pertaining to
the seven components.

Application Areas

This technology can be used for producing cast superalloy components for STFE.

USP of the Technology

Superalloy components fabricated through this technology have been accepted for use in a small
turbine engine developed by DRDO and huge demand for these engines from armed forces is
foreseen in near future.
