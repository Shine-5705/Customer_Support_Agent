Electronic Activation Device (TINY),  a miniature Electronic Activation Device (EAD)
consists   of   processing   electronics,   safety   electronics,   three   battery   power   sources,
safety plug,  LED display as  well as  I/O  keypad.  With  the  main  battery  power  circuit
completion externally, the EAD will be powered-on to ready state. In ready state, the
user   may   enter   the   required   time   input   representing   the   count   down   delay  for   final
event. Subsequent to it, with additional in-built safety logic, up on completion of count-
down,  for  simultaneously completion  of  the  final  event,   two  triggering  signals will  be
generated  across two  channels. The four channel EADs also work under the  similar
working procedure which is as mentioned above for signal channel EAD.

Micro-controller   based   processing   electronics,   rechargeable   main   battery   and   two
dedicated non-chargeable batteries for two independent channels triggering, segment
LED display interfaced to the I/O interface of the micro-controller board, internal power-
on   ready   and   triggering   logic   through   electronic   circuit   with   feedback   &   externally
hardware controlled primary supply, etc.
