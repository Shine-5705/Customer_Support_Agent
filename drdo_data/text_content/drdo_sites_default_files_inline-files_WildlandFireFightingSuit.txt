Wildland Fire-Fighting Suit 

Forest  fires  are  significantly  different  from  structural  or  other  types  of  fires,  and  hence  the 

clothing  that  is  required  to  be  worn  by  the  firefighters  handling  these  fires  differs  from  other 

type of clothing. Considering the increase in the occurrence of forest fires across the country, 

primarily during summers, there was a necessity for developing indigenous wildland fire safety 

gear. One  important  component  of  the  wildland firefighting  gear  is  the Wildland  Firefighting 

Suit. Keeping in view the performance requirements with which the wildland firefighting suit 

must  comply,  and  the  comfort  level  that  it  must  offer,  Centre  for  Fire,  Explosives  and 

Environment Safety (CFEES, DRDO), has designed a suit that offers the necessary protection 

(to  fight  the  wildland  fire)  as  mandated  by  the  applicable  Standard,  ISO  16073  –  Part  3 

(“Wildland firefighting personal protective equipment – Requirements and test methods – Part 

3: Clothing”), without compromising on the wearer’s comfort. 

The Wildland  Firefighting Suit  (WFFS) developed by  the CFEES is  a single-layered suit  and 

conforms to the protection levels mandated in ISO 16073 – Part 3, in totality. The use of high 

content of indigenous fire retardant fibers in the fabric used to fabricate the suit is the USP of 

this development, since it is an important step in the indigenisation of these suits and a major 

step forward towards self-reliance.
