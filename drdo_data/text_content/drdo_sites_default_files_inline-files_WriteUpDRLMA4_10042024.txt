Nitrile Rubber Compound (DRLM-A4)

Nitrile   rubber   is   comprised   of   the   acrylonitrile   (ACN)   and   butadiene   monomers   and   it   is   a
copolymer  of   them.  It  is  most  economical   and  recommending  elastomer   due  to  its  excellent
resistance to hydraulic fluids, silicone oils & greases, petroleum-based oils, ethylene glycol based
fluid,   water   (<100oC),   dilute   acids,   etc.  Nitrile  rubber   compounds   are   directly   related   to  the
proportion of ACN in the rubber. As the ACN content is increased, the heat resistance, ozone
resistance, abrasion resistance, resistance to petroleum based fluids and hydrocarbon oil, tensile
strength will improve with slight increase in their hardness whereas low temperature flexibility,
gas permeability and rebound resilience will decrease.

Nitrile rubber known as NBR as per ISO 1629 (formerly it was known as Buna N), bears good
mechanical   properties   when  compared  with  other   elastomers,   high  wear   resistance  and   good
aging   properties   under   severe   condition   but   more   restricted   to   weathering,   ozone,   sunlight,
aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene), polar solvents (ketone, acetone, acetic acid, ethylene ester),
strong   acids   and   high   temperature   applications.   Components   made   from   NBR   can   be   used
between -45oCand 100oC and/or 120oC for intermittent service condition. 

DMSRDE has developed a medium range nitrile based rubber compound designated as DRLM-
A4   having   hardness   between   75   and   90   Shore   ‘A’.   It   has   good   balance   between   working
temperature   range,   media   compatibility/suitability   and   their   strength.   DRLM-A4   rubber
compound is very suitable for use in air and hydraulic oil media of lower aromatic content.
