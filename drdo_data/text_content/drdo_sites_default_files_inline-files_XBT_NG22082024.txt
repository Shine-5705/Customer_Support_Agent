Expendable Bathy Thermograph – New Generation (XBT – NG)

DRDO   has  successfully  indigenized   the   ASW   capabilities  of   Indian   Navy   for   last
several   decades.  The   study   of   oceans   is   an   essential   aspect   from   strategic,
economic and ocean engineering points of view. At any given situation, the detection
and discrimination of an underwater target is highly dependent on the propagation
characteristics   of   the   medium   which   depends   on   the   in-situ   data.   Expendable
Bathythermographs   (XBT)   are   designed   for   rapid   mapping   of   upper   layer
temperature which is cost-effective, robust, and easy-to-use instrument to estimate
the sound speed profile for military application. 

The   newly   developed   XBT-NG   system   consists  of   a  probe   with   integrated
sensor, probe electronics and battery which is used to collect the temperature data
and send onboard launcher using single wire telemetry. The probe will be launched
from   an   aesthetically   designed   hand-held   launcher   having   Ethernet   and   Wi-fi
interface. The data will be transferred to Laptop/Deck unit using Wi-Fi/Ethernet. The
Deck   unit   will   send   the   data   to   PC/Laptop   via   ethernet   communication.  Human
Machine Interface (HMI) in the PC/laptop  presents the temperature profile received
and also have command control as well the algorithms for Quality Check (QC), data
blending (upto station depth) and sound velocity estimation. XBT-NG is intended to
replace all the existing systems on board the Indian Naval ships.
