Introduction 

DRDO  is  funding  multi-institutional  and  multi-disciplinary  directed  research  projects  to  Academia 

and  National  Research  Institutes  to  develop  cutting  edge  defence  technologies.  The  funding  is 

focused  on  translational  research  for  developing  the  crucial  and  futuristic  technologies  in  defined 

research  domains  through  a  network of  DRDO  Industry  Academia  â€“  Centre  of  Excellences  (DIA-

CoEs) at premier and capable academic institutes and universities in the country.   

To foster the research in academia, DFTM invites project proposals in advanced research areas of 

Additive  Manufacturing,  that  will  be  taken  up  through  DIA-CoEs  for  directed  research.  Received 

proposals  will  be  scrutinized  by  DFTM  and  forwarded  to  respective  DIA-CoEs  as  per  research 

verticals for further evaluation. 

Forms for submission are provided at drdo.gov.in/drdo/adv-tech-center  

Fully furnished project proposals shall be submitted to DFTM through techforesight.drdo@gov.in
