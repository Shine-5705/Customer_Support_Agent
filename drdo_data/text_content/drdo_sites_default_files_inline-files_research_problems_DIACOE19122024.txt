To  foster  the  research  in  academia,  DFTM  invites  project  proposals  on  problem  statements  in 
multiple areas, that will be taken up through DIA-CoEs for directed research. Received proposals 
will  be  scrutinized  by  DFTM  and  forwarded  to  respective  DIA-CoEs  as  per  research  verticals  for 
further evaluation.

Development of FPGA IP Core for 
Eigen Vector Decomposition and 
Singular Value Decomposition 

Technology Area 
Electronic Warfare 

Technology Category 
Single Processing 

Brief of the Research Problem  
Super  resolution  algorithms  for  DOA  Estimation  like  MUSIC  ,  ESPRIT  or  their  variants  require 
Eigen Vector and Singular Value Decomposition of Data Covariance Matrix estimated using signal 
samples acquired from multiple antennas. In EW, each channel has to be processed in parallel and 
therefore there is a need for efficient FPGA IP Core for EVD and SVD. Number of Antennas could 
be 2, 5, 6 or 7. It is also expected that number of sources to be estimated in the IP Core using the 
computed Eigen Values making use of Information Theoretic Criteria like AIC and MDL.  

Major Objectives  
Development of FPGA IP Core for Eigen Vector Decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition 
capable of Real Time Performance. 

Expected Deliverables 
FPGA IP Core along with Profiling Results, Test Results, Technical Report and Computational 
Requirements for Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale, Intel Stratix 10 or Xilinx Versal Computation Engines.

Model Software 

Technology Area

Technology Category 
COMINT  

Brief of the Research Problem  
In High Frequency Direction Finding (HF DF) Stations, geolocation of distant HF transmitters need 
to  be  carried  out  using  estimated  Azimuth  and  Elevation  bearings.  The  mode  of  propagation 
assumed  is  Ionospheric  or  Sky  Wave.  The  Virtual  Height  of  Ionospheric  Layer  that  caused  total 
internal reflection  of  Sky Wave  signal is dependent  on  Location, Time  of  the  Day,  Season  of  the 
Year,  Sun  Spot  Number,  Frequency  of  Signal  etc.  Scope  of  Work  is  to  identify  and  procure 
Ionospheric  Model  Software.  Further  use  information  like  Frequency  of  Signal,  Azimuth  Bearing, 
Elevation Bearing and Virtual Height obtained using Ionospheric Model Software for estimating the 
geolocation of HF Transmitter.  

Major Objectives  
Development of Single Station Location Algorithm for HF DF using Azimuth Bearing, Elevation 
Bearing and Ionospheric Model Software.  

Expected Deliverables 
Ionospheric Model Software, Simulation Results with Profiling of Execution Time, Tool for test 
signal generation, Technical Report and Geolocation Algorithm Description along with 
Computational Requirements and Code.

Classification of LPI Signals into Burst 
and FH with Hop Rate Estimation in 
Direction Finder System using Deep 
Learning/Machine Learning 

Technology Area 
Communication  

Technology Category 
Electronic Warfare 
Brief of the Research Problem  
DLRL  Direction  Finder  (DF)  System  currently  uses  azimuth  bearings  for  identifying  Frequency 
Hopper  Signals  and  also  classify  detected  signals  among  three  categories  viz.,  Fixed  Frequency 
(FF), Frequency Hopper (FH) and Burst. The DF System scans in frequency domain and performs 
DF  of  all  detected  signals.  Since  signal  processing  is  frame/batch  based  and  performed  in 
frequency domain, in parallel for each of the channels, the accuracy of time duration estimation for 
bursts  and  individual  hops  is  limited  due  to  which  Hop  Rate  estimates  are  inaccurate  for  fast 
hoppers.  It  is  required  to  develop  an  algorithm  based  on  Deep  Learning/Machine  Learning  using 
time domain IQ data from each of the two or five DF antennas to classify the received signals into 
FF,  FH  and  Burst.  Training  data  needs  to  be  generated  by  appropriate  mathematical  models  that 
should  allow  to  introduce  Noise  and  Fading.  Signal  generated  should  allow  for  multiple  signals 
present simultaneously at different frequencies within the instantaneous bandwidth. It is expected to 
be able to estimate Hop and Burst durations of the order of 200 micro seconds. The performance of 
the proposed approach need to be validated using Simulations and also test on Workstation/Laptop 
or PC using data that is generated or captured using commercial phase coherent signal acquisition 
hardware  with  minimum  2  channels.  DLRL  seeks  solutions  with  Academic  Institutions  to  develop 
and implement the Complex Statistical Digital Signal Processing Algorithms.  

Major Objectives

using Deep Learning/Machine Learning  

Expected Deliverables

training  and  test  signal  generation,  Technical  Report  and  Algorithm  Description  along  with 
Computational Requirements and Code

Emitters from RF Payloads on LEO 
Satellites 

Technology Area 
Space Technologies  

Technology Category 
Electronic Warfare  

Brief of the Research Problem  
3D  Hawk  Eye  from  USA,  is  a  “Data  as  a  Service”  Product,  that  is  made  recently  available  to 
subscribers  for  Situational  Awareness  through  Space  Based  EW.  It  consists  of  constellations  of 
satellites  in  Formation  Flying  in  LEO  &  it  is  projected  that  with  multiple  constellations  in  multiple 
orbits, revisit time for surveillance of a given area of interest would be close to 15 minutes in the 
foreseeable  future.  Targets  include  AIS,  ADS-B,  Military  Radio/Radars.  Performance  data  with 
respect to geo location accuracies is not publically available in the open domain. Similar systems 
(Kleos etc.) are being commissioned by some other countries in Europe. Difference is number and 
geometry  of  satellites  in  Formation  Flying.  Some  use  three  Satellites  in  Triangular  Geometry 
whereas, others use four satellites in Rectangular Geometry. These systems work on the principle 
of  Joint  TDOA  and  FDOA  and  require  precise  Time/Frequency  Synchronization  across  multiple 
satellites and multiple constellations. The spacecraft move at a speed of approximately 50 Kms/s. 
Knowledge  of  precise  location  of  spacecraft’s  that  carries  these  payloads  with  respect  to  a 
common  frame  of  reference  is  mandatory  apart  from  synchronization  requirements  listed  above. 
The digitized IQ data of the signals received would have to be recorded when spacecraft is moving 
with  area  of  interest  in  the  field  of  view.  The  recorded  data  would  have  to  be  relayed  back  to 
Ground Control Station (GCS) when it is in field of view of the spacecraft’s. All the signal detection 
and  parameter  estimation  would  have  to  be  done  on  the  ground  to  perform  geolocation  of  the 
potential emitters. DLRL seeks solutions with Academic Institutions to develop and implement the 
Algorithms.  

Major Objectives  
Development of Practically Implementable Algorithms for Geolocation of Terrestrial Radio Emitters 
from RF Payloads on LEO Satellites that will be enabling technology for future Projects  

Expected Deliverables 
System  Design  Document  specifying  Satellite  Geometry,  Trajectory,  Data  Link  Throughput,  RF 
Payload  Capabilities,  Signal  Processing  Algorithms  for  Payload,  Ground  Station  for  Geolocation 
Computation along with Profiling of Execution Time, Simulation Results for Statistical Performance 
Evaluation, Tool for signal generation, Technical Report, Algorithm Description and Computational 
Requirements.
