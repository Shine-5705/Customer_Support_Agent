LIGHT AS A WEAPON: DRDO’S DEW MARKS 
INDIA’S DEFENCE MILESTONE

cost	

Mastering  the  technology  of 
disabling  missiles,  drones  and 
smaller  projectiles  with  Laser- 
Directed  Energy  Weapon  (DEW) 
has  long  been  the  holy  grail  of 
air  defence.  The  DEW  will  soon 
be  replacing  traditional  kinetic 
weapons  and  missile  defence 
systems due to its ease of operation 
and	
effectiveness.	 The	
proliferation  of  Unmanned  Aerial 
Systems (UAS) and the emergence 
of  drone  swarms  as  asymmetric 
threats  are  driving  the  demand 
for  DEWs  with  counter-UAS  and 
counter-swarm  capabilities.  The 
extent  of  havoc  can  be  caused 
by  UAVs  and  drones  is  visible 
in	 all	 the	 recent	 conflicts	 like	
ongoing	 Russia-Ukraine	 conflict,	

Armenia-Azerbaijan	 conflicts	 or	
Houthis	attack	on	US	naval	fleets	
where  relatively  weaker  state  and 
non-state  players  are  accruing 
disproportionate  gains  against 
their stronger adversaries.

tracking 

Once  detected  by  a  radar 
followed  by 
through 
Electro-optic  (EO)  system,  laser-
DEW  can  engage  targets  at  the 
speed of light, and use an intense 
beam  of  powerful 
laser  beam 
to  neutralize  the  target,  leading 
to  structural 
failure  or  more 
impactful  results.  This  type  of 
cutting-edge  weaponry  has  the 
potential to revolutionize the battle 
space  by  reducing  the  reliance 
on  expensive  ammunition,  while 
also lowering the risk of collateral 

damage. The requirement for cost-
effective	defence	solutions	to	offset	
the  low-cost  drone  attacks  amidst 
constrained  defence  budget 
is 
driving  the  adoption  of  DEWs  by 
military organizations worldwide. 
Prototype  of  Mk-II(A)  DEW

This  milestone 
achieved  has  demonstrated  the 
ability to engage aerial targets at a

INDIGENOUSLY-DEVELOPED VLSRSAM

The  Defence  Research  &

conducted	 the	 successful	 flight	
test of the indigenously developed 
Vertically-Launched 
Short-
Surface-to-Air  Missile 
Range 
(VLSRSAM)  from  the  Integrated 
Test	 Range	 (ITR),	 Chandipur,	 off	
the  coast  of  Odisha  on  26  March 
2025.	 The	 flight	 test	 was	 carried	
out  from  a  land-based  vertical 
launcher  against  a  high-speed 
aerial  target  at  very  close  range 
and low altitude. It has established 
the  near-boundary-low-altitude 
capability of the missile system.

During  the  test,  the  target 
was  completely  destroyed  by  the 
missile executing the high turn rate 
required  for  engaging  targets  at 
very  close  range  and  establishing 

the missile’s agility, reliability, and 
pinpoint  accuracy.  The  test  was 
conducted with all weapon system 
elements  deployed 
in  combat 
configuration.	 These	 elements,	
including  the  missile  with  an 
indigenous radio frequency seeker, 
multi-function radar, and weapon 
control system, have performed as 
per expectations. The performance 
of the system was validated by the 
flight	 data	 captured	 by	 various
