These are the technologies for which Indian Armed Forces/ MHA/ other Govt. agencies (both central & state) are the only end users. Category ‘A’ technologies are military technologies and are referred to as “MILTECH”. Export of Cat ‘A’ technologies is subjected to approval process of DRDO and MoD, Govt of India. ToT to the industry is done directly by DRDO for all Category ‘A’ technologies.
