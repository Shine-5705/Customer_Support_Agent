Non-technical Note 

Rubber lining system for  submarine battery pit compartments and its application 
technology  

Battery pits of submarine are highly prone to corrosion due to spillage of sulfuric acid. NMRL 

has developed  a rubber lining system and its  application methodology,  which when applied on 

board  the  battery  pit  compartments  of  submarines  can  provide  a  service  life  of  more  than  ten 

years  in  the  corrosive  environment  for  more  than  ten  years.  The  lining  system  comprises  the 

following components: 

1. Vulcanized neoprene rubber sheets compounded with speciality fillers 

2. NMR51 adhesive for surface modification of rubber sheet (to be sourced from ToT partners) 

3. Epoxy putty (to be sourced from ToT partners) 

4. Polyurethane sealant (to be sourced from ToT partners) 

Neoprene rubber lined mock up structure of battery pit compartment 

The neoprene rubber is compounded suitably to provide excellent acid resistance and mechanical 

properties, fabricated by calendaring to the required thickness. The method of application of the 

neoprene  rubber  sheets  on  board  the  battery  pit  compartment  is    based  on  a  nesting  plan  to 

conformally secure the lining system using the sealant and adhesive.
