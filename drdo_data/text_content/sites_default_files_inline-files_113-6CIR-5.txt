Brief Description of Transfer of Technology 

on 

High Strength Aluminium Alloy Extrusions for the Manufacture of Hard Anodized 
Components for an Anti-tank Ammunition 

1. 

Description of the technology 

The technology involving thermal and extrusion processing of high strength, 7xxx series Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Cr 
based DTD5124 alloy having suitable alloy composition, extrusion processing parameters and optimum 
aging heat treatments is disclosed. Optimization of the aforemen-tioned process parameters enables the 
fully heat treated extrusions to have the acceptable width of the peripheral recrystallized layer, desired 
tensile properties and to develop the desired thickness of the hard anodic oxide coating on the machined 
components in an uninterrupted single step. 

2. 

Application areas 

This  technology  has  been  developed  and  demonstrated  at  the  industrial  scale.  This  technology  is 
currently  in  use  for  the  manufacture  of  Tail  unit  and  Sabot  components  of  the  fin  stabilized  armour 
piercing  discarding  sabot  (FSAPDS)  –  an  anti-tank  ammunition  for  Indian  Army.  The  components  are 
machined from the heat treated extrusions and thereafter hard anodized for the targeted application.
