Aluminium Alloy Armour Plates for Infantry Combat Vehicle/Armoured Vehicle 

1. 

Description of the technology 

The  technology  involving  optimization  of  alloy  composition,  casting  parameters,  homogenization 
schedule  and  aging  heat  treatment  for  the  production  of  plates  of  aluminium-copper-magnesium-
manganese-zirconium-titanium-vanadium alloy (AA2519) for armoured vehicle applications is disclosed.  
Optimization  of  the  aforementioned  processes  enables  the  production  of  sound  cast  slabs  and  the 
resultant  heat  treated  plates  of  desired  dimensions  and  having  reproducible  tensile  properties  with 
reduced in-plane strength anisotropy. 

2. 

Application areas 

This  technology  has  been  developed  and  demonstrated  at  the  industrial  scale.    The  technology  has 
been  assessed  in  terms  of  ballistic  tests  against  the  prevailing  threat  level  of  the  armoured  vehicles.  
These alloy plates may be utilized in combination with other armour materials for similar applications.

 The  15  mm  thick  plates  of  the  alloy  were  subjected  to  ballistic  tests  against  7.62  x  54  mm  AP  (I) 
ammunition.  The  test  requirement  is  7.62 X  54 mm  AP(I)  at  average  proof  velocity  of 509  m/s. The 
tests showed 6% superior results with reference to MIL-STD-46192C (MR).
