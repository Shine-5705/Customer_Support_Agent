Brief Description of Transfer of Technology 

on 

Aluminium-Copper-Manganese-Zirconium-Titanium-Vanadium Based AA2219 Alclad 

Sheets and Plates for Missile Applications 

1. 

Description of the technology 

The technology involving optimization of parameters like alloy composition, homogenization schedule, 
hot  and  cold  rolling  parameters,  method  of  imparting  cold  work  prior  to  artificial  aging  for  the 
production  of  AA2219  Alclad  sheets  and  plates  has  been  developed.  Optimization  of  the 
aforementioned  process  parameters  enabled  the  production  of  Alclad  AA2219  sheets  and  plates 
having thicknesses ranging from 2 mm to 30 mm having reproducible tensile properties and reduced 
in-plane strength anisotropy. 

2. 

Application areas 

This  technology has been  developed and demonstrated at  the  industrial  scale.    The technology  has 
been assessed in terms of structural tests wherein 4 mm thick Alclad AA2219 sheets were formed and 
joined to form a structural part of a major load bearing section of a missile.
