Brief Description of Transfer of Technology 
on 
Aluminium-Zinc-Magnesium Based Alloy Sheets and Plates Having Desired Strength and High 
Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) Resistance for Military Bridging System 

1. 

Description of the technology 

The technology involving optimization of copper-free aluminium-zinc-magnesium-manganese-zirconium 
alloy composition and formulation of a novel aging heat treatment for the production of sheets and plates 
of the alloy having thicknesses in the range of 4 mm to 20 mm has been developed.  These materials 
possess a combination of desired strength [0.2% PS = 300 MPa (minimum)] and high stress corrosion 
cracking resistance [%IACS â‰¥ 40 minimum]. 

2. 

Application areas 

This technology has been developed and demonstrated at the industrial scale. The technology has been 
assessed  in  terms  of  structural  tests of  Sarvatra Bridging  system  wherein  the  sheets and  plates were 
utilized to make structural parts of the bridge.
