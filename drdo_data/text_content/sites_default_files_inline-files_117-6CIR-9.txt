Brief Description of Transfer of Technology 

on 

Aluminium-Magnesium Based Alloy Sheets and Plates for Superstructures in  
Naval Warship 

1. 

Description of the technology 

The technology involving optimization of aluminium-magnesium-manganese-chromium based DMR291A 
alloy  composition,  formulation  of  various  thermal  and  deformation  process  parameters  including 
homogenization treatment, hot rolling parameters to realize plates in M temper, cold rolling parameters 
and post cold rolling annealing cycle to realize sheets in H24 temper has been developed.  The resultant 
materials are weldable and not susceptible to stress corrosion cracking and exfoliation corrosion.  The 
materials meet the tensile and other mechanical property requirements for the targeted applications.   

2. 

Application areas 

This technology has been developed and demonstrated at the industrial scale. The resultant materials 
(having  thicknesses  ranging  from  0.9  to  30  mm)  met  all  the  property  requirements  for  use  in  the 
manufacture of superstructures of naval warship.
