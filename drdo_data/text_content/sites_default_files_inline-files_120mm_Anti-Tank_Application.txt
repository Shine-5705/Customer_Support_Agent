120mm Tandem Warhead System for Anti-Tank Application

TBRL has developed 120mm tandem shaped charge warhead systems for Anti-

Tank Application. In tandem warhead system configuration, two shaped charge

namely  main shaped charge  and  precursor shaped charge  are mounted in

the same missile and are initiated one after the other with pre-defined time delay

of  the order of micro seconds. Both these shaped charges are mounted at a

certain   distance   from   each   other   keeping   in   view   the   warhead   system

constraints. It is necessary to protect the second charge (Main Shaped Charge)

from the blast effects of the first charge (Precursor shaped charge) during the

time delay between the initiations of two shaped charges.

The advanced  homogeneous armour, add  –ones like ERA and active  armour

protection   systems   are   normally   being   used   for   protection   of   latest   MBT’s.

Hence   the  requirement   of  tandem   shaped  charge  warhead  emerges.  Various

performance evaluation trials have been carried out to ensure the capability of

tandem warhead to defeat ERA protected RHA.
