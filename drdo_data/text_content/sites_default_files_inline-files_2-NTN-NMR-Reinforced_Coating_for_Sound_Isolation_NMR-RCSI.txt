NMR-Reinforced Coating for Sound Isolation (NMR-RCSI) 

Reinforced coatings (RC) are installed between interhull spaces of submarines. These are sound 
insolating tiles which prevent acoustic energy emission through submarine hull. These coatings 
help  in  reducing  self  noise  of  the  submarine  caused  by  vibration  and  onboard  machinery. 
Reinforced  coatings are designed to function  at pressures  up to 6MPa.  The  RC is  a  multilayer 
tile with alternate layers of FRP and perforated rubber sheet. The FRP and Perforated Rubber 
sheets  are  adhesively  bonded  to  each  other  using  NMR  51K  adhesive.  The  edges  of  the 
multilayer structure are sealed with Polyurethane sealant to prevent water penetration. The RC 
is  fabricated  in  two  forms  1)  Flat  panels  for  fitting  on  the  flat  surfaces  2)  Curved  panels  for 
fitting on the submarine hull structure. The fitting of RC on to the structures is by mechanical 
bolting.
