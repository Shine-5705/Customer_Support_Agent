Air Sterilization Unit (ASU) for ATVP 

Accumulation of microorganisms in  a closed ecosystem leads to spread of infectious 

diseases  and  allergies  among  crew  members  apart  from  production  of  toxic 

metabolites, damage of materials and degradation of environmental hygiene. DEBEL 

has successfully developed air sterilization unit (ASU) for submarine application. The 

system works on the principle of UV irradiation and  can be continuously used for 8000 

h. The Electronic Control Unit has been designed to display the working of UV bulbs. 

The  system  achieved  99.999%  reduction  of bacteria  (endospores  of  Bacillus  subtilis) 

and virus (T7 bacteriophage). The developed ASU is a promising system not only for 

use in submarines but   spinoff of technology can be effectively used  in bio-defence 

deployable  shelters,  CBRN  bunkers  and  mobile  laboratories.  Moreover,  civilian 

applications  like  hospitals  and  amphi-theaters  can  also  benefit  from  the  developed 

system.
