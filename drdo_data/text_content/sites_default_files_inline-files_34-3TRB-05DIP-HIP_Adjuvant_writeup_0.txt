                      Herbal adjuvant DIP-HIP 

Herbal adjuvant DIP-HIP, derived from Himalayan herb, is developed to enhance the 
immunogenicity of vaccines.   

(cid:153)  The adjuvant activity of the extract is confirmed by purifying the extract, and 

identifying a bioactive component. 

(cid:153)  Safe, efficacious, enhances protective antibody response, with no side effects.  

(cid:153)  Modulates both the arms of immunity (Th1 and Th2 immune response). 

(cid:153)  Long term sustenance of antibodies . 

(cid:153)  Compatible with different antigens, with reduced number of boosters. 

(cid:153)  Non-immunogenic by itself with no batch variation. 

(cid:153)  Superior to alternative adjuvants when judged by immunopotency criteria, and 

collectively by bio-active qualities, syringeability, and manufacturability.
