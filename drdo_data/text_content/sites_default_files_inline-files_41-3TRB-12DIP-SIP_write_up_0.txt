Replenishment Drink ‘DIP-SIP’ 

Background: 
Human body functions best within a fixed range of internal milieu, for which temperature 
is  a  crucial  component.  Warm  climate  often  causes  physical  discomfort  and  cognitive 
apathy,  leading  to  deterioration  of  individual’s  physical  performance.  The  most 
detrimental  effect  of  heat  stress  is  dehydration,  due  to  sweating.  In  prolonged  sweating 
blood  volume  gets  affected  leading  to  hypohydration.  Sweating  along  with  water  loss, 
produces  loss  of  electrolytes,  mainly  sodium  (Na+)  and  chloride  (Cl–),  along  with 
magnesium  (Mg++),  zinc  (Zn++),  calcium  (Ca++)  etc.  If  sweat  loss  is  replaced  only  by 
water this leads to situation where body contains fewer electrolytes than in normal state 
(hypo-osmotic).  Commercially  prepared  sports  and  energy  drinks  have  varying 
concentrations of glucose and sodium, ranging from hypertonic to hypotonic with respect 
to  plasma.  Apart  from  sodium  and  carbohydrate,  drinks  seldom  replenish  other 
electrolytes.  Some  drinks  add  caffeine  for  commercial  acceptance  but  has  antagonistic 
physiological effect on user. In such circumstances, DIPAS developed a “Replenishment 
Drink DIP-SIP”. 

Potential Benefits: 

•  Providing  fluid,  electrolyte,  and  carbohydrate  replacement  during  physical  work 

under heat stress. 

•  Providing  rapid  rehydration  following  heavy  or  prolonged  physical  work,  thereby 

facilitating recovery from heat injury. 

•  Reducing the increase in core temperature (CT).  

•  Reducing the increase in Mean skin temperature (MST). 

•  Reducing cardiovascular stress.  

•  Additional supplementation (like Copper, Selenium, Manganese, Magnesium, etc) to 

compensate for electrolyte loss during hypohydration.   

•  Encouraging fluid intake due to extra palatability and flavour. 

•  Beneficial in delaying decrement of physical performance.   

Applications: 

•  DIP-SIP can help alleviate heat stress and dehydration for both dry and humid heat. 
•  DIP-SIP is able to tackle dehydration while working under high ambient heat stress. 
•  DIP-SIP helps delay onset of fatigue and stress if taken prior to heat stress exposure. 
•  DIP-SIP helps to regain lost electrolytes, when consumed at regular intervals during 

exposure.
