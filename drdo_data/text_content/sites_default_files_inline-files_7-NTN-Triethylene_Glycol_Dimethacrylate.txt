Triethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate

NMRL has developed special polyester resin for adhering special rubber article onto metal
surface. Unlike conventional polyester resin where the diluent is styrene, the polyester resin
is a solution of unsaturated polyester in triethylene glycol dimethacrylate. The final usage of
resin is in the curable form which is done under electron beam irradiation. The qualitative
requirement of resin
included transparent liquid, curable under EB treatment as per
specification, reasonable pot life and easy applicability. The resin is formulated in such a
way that it gives optimum performance without failing in adhesion along with epoxy putty
when the adhered structure is used underwater. The advantage of this resin over
commercial resin is that it is styreneless, nontoxic and excellent storage life.
