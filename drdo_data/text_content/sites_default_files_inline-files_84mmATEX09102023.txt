High Explosive Technologies for 84mm ATEX Shell (PBXPW-1) 

Description of Technology: 
There was a need to develop high explosive technologies for the blast type of ammunition to 
destroy various targets.  

High  explosive  technology  has  been  developed  by  DRDO  to  destroy  various  targets. 
Exhaustive studies were carried out to finalize the HE compositions and their filling methodologies 
in warhead to realize the required performance lethality at the desired distances. The pressable HE 
technology has been developed for the main filling of the shell and for the booster charge.   

More powerful main filling of HE composition has been finalized for the Blast (BF) shell. Booster 
pellets are of HE composition (PBXP 101). They are developed for continuation of explosive train.  
HE  preparation  and  pressing  for  shell  of  ATEX  has  been  established.  All  trials  such  as  static 
performance,  fuze  initiation,  SD  explosive  train,  blast,  dynamic  trials  of  ammunitions  for  design 
validation  and  final  performance  has  been  completed  successfully.  Developed  high  explosive 
composition met QR. 

Application Areas: 
High  explosive  compositions  and  their  filling  in  shell  of  PBXPW-1  is  designed  and  developed  by 
DRDO to destroy various targets by blast at short distance. 

Unique Selling Point (USP): 
All  the  trials  including  User  trials  of  ammunition  in  both  static  and  flight  modes  have  been 
completed successfully. Developed technology met QR and it is equivalent to global level. All the 
raw materials for the filling of warhead system are available indigenously. The equipments required 
for the preparation of explosive composition and filling are available within India.
