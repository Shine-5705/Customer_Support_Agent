Activated Carbon Fabric (ACF) based CBRN Suit (CBRN Suit Mk VI) 

Activated  carbon  is  available  in  different  forms  viz;  powders,  beads,  fibers  and  fabrics. 

Activated  carbon  in  fabric  or  fiber  form  is  known  to  be  more  advanced  form  with  significant 

advantages  over  conventional  forms  like  powders  or  beads.  The  technology  of  ACF  is  the 

outcome  of  combination  of  technology  for  carbon  fiber  manufacturing  and  its  activation.  The 

important advantages of ACF over conventional activated carbon materials are  

  Smaller  fiber  diameter  which  minimizes  mass  transfer  limitations;  enhancing  sorption 

rate. 

  Rapid  adsorption/  desorption,  more  homogeneous  pore  size  distribution,  excellent 

adsorption capacity at low concentration of adsorbates. 

  Possibility of confining the fibers in various physical forms like tows, fabrics, and felts. 

ACF  is  derived  by  carbonization  and  activation  of  viscose  rayon,  PAN,  pitch  and  phenolic  resin 

based textile fabric. The new textile protective clothing made from ACF is light, flexible and highly 

permeable providing more comfort to the wearer. These ACFs have been invariably used in inner 

or middle layer of a multiple layer fabric for protective clothing.  ACF based suit are designed with 

extra protection at the wrist and leg, inherent & antistatic outer fabric is made of blended yarn and 

Indian Army disruptive pattern. It is developed in four sizes S, M, L, XL.  

Reinforcements  in  the  form  of  woven  films  or  fabrics  help  to  improve  strength  and  abrasion 

resistance.  A lot of interest has been generated in recent years among researchers to reduce the 

cost of precursor so that the cost of ACF is low. DMSRDE has developed the ACF technology for 

 
 
         
 
the development of advanced version of ACF based CBRN suits with chemical protection of more 

than 24 hours against CWA.
