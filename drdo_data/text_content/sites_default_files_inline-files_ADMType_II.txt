Area Denial Munition Type-II warhead for Artillery Rocket System  

This  is  one  type  of  ammunition  to  be  deployed  for  Multi  Barrel  Rocket  System.  This 

ammunition  uses  already  developed  Ground  system,  propulsion  &  launcher  POD 

assembly.  The warhead portion for which present TOT is being proposed houses the 

ADM type-II munitions.  

The warhead consists of an outer ballistic casing, which is made up of Al Alloy Ogive & 

Shell  assemblies.  Sub-munitions  are  packed  along  the  length  of  the  warhead  in  six 

layers and each layer consists of three Nos. These are axi-symmetrically packed inside 

the  casing.  The  ejection  of  these  munitions  near  the  target  area  is  one  of  key  design 

activity. Flexible Liner Shaped Charge (FLSC) coupled with spring-based force ejection 

mechanism is developed and proved in several dynamic trials.  

Munition  houses  the  required  kill  mechanism.    In  addition,  it  is  having  the  Safety  and 

arming  Mechanism  (SAM)  which  caters  for  full  safety  during  handling,  storage  and 

transportation.  Also,  the  SAM  would  provide  necessary  launcher  and  flight  safety. 

Munition is initiated by an electro-magnetic fuze. The fuze triggers the ATM on sensing 

the  required  change  in  magnetic  flux  when  a  Tank  passes  over  that.  The  fuze  also 

contains an anti-tilt device in addition to self-destruct capability.
