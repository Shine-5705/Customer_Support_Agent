ADVANCED MICROCLIMATE COOLING SYSTEM (AMCCS) 

Battle  tank  crew  deployed  in  desert  ops  are  subjected  to  extreme  heat  stress.  The 

temperature inside the battle tank is reported to be 7-9 degrees higher than the prevailing ambient 

temperature due to reduced ventilation and radiation from metal. If the personnel have to operate 

wearing thermally restrictive clothing, the thermal stress will aggravate further. Mitigation of heat 

stress is essential to enhance mission endurance. Air conditioning of these vehicles leads to added 

weight  and  wastage  of  a  lot  of  energy.  Therefore,  cooling  personnel  is  the  near  perfect  solution 

using microclimate cooling system which consists of an active cooling unit and a Liquid Cooled 

Garment.  The  AMCCS  is  comprised  of  a  Liquid  Cooled  Garment  (LCG)  and  an  active  Chiller. 

DEBEL  has  developed  two  active  cooling  systems  based  on  the  requirement  of  MBT  cell  of 

CVRDE.  The  developed  systems  utilize  vapour  compression 

technology  (refrigeration 

technology) and are capable of working in an ambient of 55 Deg C. 

The systems developed for MBT are backpack cooling system, capable of providing 200 

Watts  of  cooling  [intended  for  Driver  and  Loader  as  individual  cooling  systems  and  Twin  crew 

cooling station (intended for Commander and the Gunner as single unit). The latter can provide 

400 Watts of cooling and weighs under 6 kgs.
