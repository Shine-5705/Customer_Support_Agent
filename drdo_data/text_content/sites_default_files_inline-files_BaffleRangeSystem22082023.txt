BAFFLE RANGE SYSTEM 

SMART SOLUTION FOR SMALL ARMS PRACTICE FIRING 

Conventional  Classification  Ranges  used  for  firing  practice  with  small  arms  are  provided  with  a 
danger area extended up to 1830m behind the stop butt. The danger area provides a safe zone for 
the misdirected bullets resulting from possible errors made during practice firing. The area required 
for  the  classification  range  with  fill  danger  area  is  around  500  acres  which  is  quite  huge.  These 
ranges were not very safe and several accidents have been reported because the free flight bullet can 
travel up to 3 to 4 km. Moreover, there is an overall shortage of classification ranges primarily due 
to non-availability of adequate and suitable land for constructing safe and efficient ranges. 

TBRL,  Chandigarh  has  indigenously  developed  the  concept  of  a  range  with  reduced  danger  area 
requirement,  termed  as  Baffle  Range,  as  an  alternative,  effective  and  safe  facility  for  small  arms 
practice firing without comprising training objectives. Baffle range used improvised concepts of a 
system of ground barriers,  side walls, baffle walls and stop- butt to  arrest  the misdirected bullets. 
The land required for a Baffle Range can be reduced to 5-20 acres by providing suitable designed 
ballistic  protective  structures  (i.e.  baffle  walls,  side  walls,  ground  barriers,  stop  butt  etc.)  at 
specified locations, properly  conditioned impact surfaces, regular upkeep of impact area and strict 
enforcement  of  safety  rules/  precautions  in  the  range.  Such  a  great  saving  of  land  creates  a 
possibility of having practice firing ranges at cantonments with short availability of land. 

Advantages of Baffle Range 

  Land requirement reduced to 5 acres for 100m firing Range. 
  Promote safe and efficient firing practice. 
  Designed  to  prevent  injury  to  personnel  and  to  prevent  damage  outside  the  range  from 

misdirected firing and ricochets, if firing is executed within permissible firing errors. 

  Includes provision for ease of maintenance and safety. 

Salient Features of Baffle Range 

  Existing Baffle Range Sizes: 100,200,300,400 and 500m 
  Providing with sacrificial bullet resistant FICS (Fibers Impregnated in Concrete Slurry) panels 

& CRS (Composite Rubber Steel) Panels developed based on extensive trials. 

  Design caters for eight firers in lying, kneeling and standing position 
  The design provides a safety of 15 in the horizontal plane and 15 in vertical plane. 
  Weapons  authorized  on  the  Baffle  Range  include  9mm  Carbine  &  Pistol;  5.56  mm  INSAS 

Rifle & LMG; 7.62mm SLR; AK-47 etc 

  Site area for Baffle range is 125m wide and (L+50) m long where L is maximum firing to be 

accommodated. 

  Enclosed type stop butt for maximum safety 
  Baffle  Range  facilitates  three  types  of  ground  barriers  based  on  topographic  and  climatic 

condition of area. 

  Baffle Range has the provision of portable acoustic canopy above firing position to reduce the 

outdoor noise levels.
