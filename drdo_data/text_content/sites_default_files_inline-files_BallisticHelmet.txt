Ballistic Helmet 

DMSRDE, DRDO Kanpur has successfully developed ballistic helmet which provides protection 
against 9 x 19 mm ammunition. This helmet is made up of light weight composite materials 
which are molded as per Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) design. The helmet is in layered 
structure which absorbs the impact energy of the bullet and the Behind Armour Blunt trauma 
(BABT)/Back  Face  Signature  (BFS)  is  less  than  13  mm  against  9x19  mm  ammunition.  The 
moulding  of  helmet  shell  is  carried  out  under  optimum  processing  parameters  by 
compression moluding in a hydraulic press. This helmet defeats the bullets in both dry and 
wet conditions.
