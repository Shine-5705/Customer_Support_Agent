Biodegradable cutlery 

Biodegradable  cutlery  is  produced  by  reinforcement  of  natural  fiber  (Agro-waste)  into 

matrix/resin which is a polymer of renewable resources, and is formed by compression 

or injection process. Biodegradable Tableware (spoon, fork, spork, bowl, khullad, plate, 

tea cup) can be used as alternate to the plastic tableware as natural biopolymers offer 

significant  benefits  such  as  degradability,  biocompatibility,  and  biological  safety  as 

compared  to  plastic  that  persists  in  the  environment  with  environmental  hazards.  The 
biodegradable  cutlery  is  suitable  for  serving  hot  and  cold  meals  (-300  C  to  850  C). 

Biodegradability is within 180 days and compostable in 90 days in natural environment. 

Due  to  their  biodegradable  and  durable  nature  it  is  targeted  to  meet  packaging 

requirements of food products and extend the shelf life of products without harming the 

environment.  Bio-degradable  cutlery  and  tableware  are  an  alternative  to  the  non-

biodegradable plastics to be utilized by services and civil population.
