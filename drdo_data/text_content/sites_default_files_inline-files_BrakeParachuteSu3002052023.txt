Brake Parachute  System for Su-30 Aircraft

Brake parachute is used to assist normal wheel braking and to reduce the landing run of the

aircraft. The parachute produces its maximum decelerating force immediately after opening

following aircraft touchdown, or at a time when wheel brakes are not very effective, especially

when the runway is wet or icy. 

When aircraft lands on runway in normal/emergency condition or during an aborted takeoff

situation, pilot of the aircraft initiate stream button in aircraft cockpit. The door of parachute

container gets opened and the spring loaded auxiliary parachute comes out of container. With

the help of drag of auxiliary parachute, pack cover along with main parachute extracted from

container   and   main   parachute   comes   out   from   pack   cover.   The   inflated   main   parachute

produces the drag to reduce the speed of aircraft in turn reducing the landing run.  The inflated

parachute is shown in figure.

The Brake parachute system is fabricated using various textile materials and metal parts. It

consists of following major components/subsystems-
