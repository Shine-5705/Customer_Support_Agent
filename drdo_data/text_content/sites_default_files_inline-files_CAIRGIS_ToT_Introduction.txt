CAIR GIS (Geographical Information System) Technology

CAIRGIS is the indigenous GIS technology designed and developed by Centre for

Artificial   Intelligence   and   Robotics   (CAIR)   Bangalore.     The   technology   has   been

developed   with   the   objective   of   having   a   home   grown   GIS   solution   to   meet   the

requirements   of   Indian   defence   forces.   CAIRGIS   technology   is   a   suite   of   GIS

libraries   that   can   be   customised   to   meet   the   specific   GIS   requirements   of   a

collaborative   defence   environment.   It   can   be   used   as   the   base   platform   to   build

military GIS applications to facilitate joint planning, management and monitoring of

military   operations.   It   is   capable   of   visualisation   and   analysis   of   wide   variety   of

spatial data in general and military data in specific. The technology is currently being

used   in   a   number   of   DRDO   projects   including   the   HMI   of   Missiles   and   SONAR

Systems.
