Compact Airborne Multi sensors optronic Payload (CAMOP) 

Compact Airborne  Multi-sensors Optronic Payload has been  developed for day and night 
surveillance,  reconnaissance, target  detection  and  target  tracking  from  airborne  platform. 
The  CAMOP  comprises  of  Payload  assembly,  Gimbal  assembly,  System  electronic  unit 
and Man Machine Interface (MMI). The payload assembly consists of HD Thermal imager 
and  HD  Color  Day  TV  for  better  imaging  at  longer  ranges.  The  HD  SWIR  camera  will 
extend  the  range  performance  in  degraded  visual  conditions  of  light  fog  and  smoke,  in 
addition  to  providing  imaging  at  dusk  and  dawn  conditions.  The  Low  Light  Level  TV  will 
provide  images  under  extreme  low  light  conditions  and  also  the  images  of  targets 
illuminated by the laser illuminator. The multiple Lase payloads will provide target ranges, 
CAMOP  has  also  Geo-pointing  and  Geo-  location  (GPLM)  capability  on  moving  map 
enabling  the  system  to  calculate  the  target  co-ordinates  (in  the  centre  of  the  image) 
according  to  the  navigation  data,  sensor’s  LOS  angles  and  range  from  the  Laser  Range 
Finder and display it in the centre of the image.
