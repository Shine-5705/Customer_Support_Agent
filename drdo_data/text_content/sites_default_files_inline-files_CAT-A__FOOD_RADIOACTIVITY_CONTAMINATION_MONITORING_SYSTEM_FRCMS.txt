FOOD RADIOACTIVITY CONTAMINATION MONITORING SYSTEM (FRCMS) 

Radioactivity  in  excess  from  its  natural  level  in  the  environment  can  have  harmful  effects  on 
living  being.  Food  chain  is  the  most  important  route  through  which  a  person  gets  contaminated 
internally form radioactivity and exposed from harmful radiations. International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) has stipulated isotope  specific  radioactivity limit for general consumption of various food items 
for  controlling  the  internal  exposure  during  nuclear  /  radiological  emergencies.  Quick  radioactivity 
assessment  in  food  stuffs and  drinks  is  thus  the  utmost  requirement  for managing  personnel  /  public 
radiation exposure.  

Defence  Laboratory,  Jodhpur  has  developed  a  “Food  Radioactivity  Contamination  Monitoring 
System (FRCMS)” as shown in Fig.1, for measuring the radioactivity concentration in edible items. It is an 
indigenous development “First of its kind” in India, which accommodates raw food samples and drinks 
for radioactivity measurement. It generates visual warning (Green, Yellow & Red) based on radioactivity 
level.  It  indentifies  the  radioisotope/s  and  computes  gross  as  well  as  isotope/s  activity  and  generates 
sample contamination analysis report. The system is primarily developed for armed forces, however will 
be  equally  useful  to  NDRF,  VIP  security  forces  and  custom  departments.  FRCMS  can  also  be  used  for 
civilian  /  research  applications  during  peace  time  natural  radioactivity  measurement  in  variety  of 
samples.
