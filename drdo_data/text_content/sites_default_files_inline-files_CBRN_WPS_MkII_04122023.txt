CBRN Water Purification System Mk-II 

                 In a CBRN warfare/ disaster   like flood scenario, water bodies get contaminated with 
fallout  radioactive  dust,  dispersed  Chemical  &  Biological  agents,  Toxins,  etc.  Ingestion  of  this 
contaminated  water  causes  severe  health  issues  and  may  lead  to  death.  Based  on  Armed 
forces  requirement,  a  mobile  vehicle  mounted  CBRN  Water  Purification  System  with  captive 
power source has been developed by DRDO, Defence Laboratory, Jodhpur, for treating  water 
contaminated  with  CBRN  agents,  turbid  water  &  Salinity.  It  is  operable  in  Desert,  Plains  and 
High Altitude area, with sub-Zero temperature storage capability and having capacity of 2500 to 
6000  litres  /  hr.  It  can  be  housed  in  a  Shelter  &  mounted  on  Stallion  vehicle.  Captive  power 
source  of  Diesel  Generator  set  CQAL  640A  Qualified  used  and  having  PLC  &  SCADA  based 
automatic  control.  It  is  a  unique  system  in  the  world  having  hot  desert  &  cold  desert  (high 
altitude)  compliance.  Purified  water  meets  drinking  water  services/  emergency  standard 
requirement. 

Application: 

  Purification of CBRN agent contaminated water during war time. 

  Contaminated water purification during terrorist/ intentional Radiological attack disaster 

  To provide potable water from turbid/ saline feed water at plains, and hilly area. 

  Provide potable water during disaster.
