CHEMICAL MECHANICAL POLISHING AGENT CEPSEL-86 FOR PLANARIZING 
THE SILICON CARBIDE SURFACE 

Silicon  carbide  possesses  unique  electrical  and  physical  properties  that 

make  it  suitable  for  high  power,  high  frequency  and  high  temperature  electronic 

devices including ICs. Such properties have fueled an intense research effort in the 

recent decades that has prompted the need to develop larger area defect/damage-

free  silicon  carbide  wafers.  The  preparation  of  silicon  carbide  wafers  is  require 

multiple  polishing  steps  including  a  mechanical  polishing  step  in  which  particles 

which  are  typically  harder  than  silicon  carbide  are  used  to  achieve  reasonable 

silicon  carbide  polishing  rates.  The  very  hard  particles  used  for    the  mechanical 

polishing  usually    results    high  degree  of  damage  by  generating  scratches  and 

dislocations on  surface and sub-surface of the silicon carbide wafer.  

Typically 

the abrasives that are harder than silicon carbide provide reasonably high polishing 

rates,  but  cause  significant  Surface  and  Sub-Surface  damage.  However,  the 

abrasive  particles  which  are  softer  than  silicon  carbide  typically  provide  low 

polishing  rates,  and  significantly  less  damage.  Since  the  CMP  particles  used  are 

still  significantly  abrasive,  new  damage  is  generated  during  the  CMP  process. 

Therefore,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  new  CMP  slurries  and/or  methods  for 

polishing  silicon  carbide  comprising  materials  which  minimize  the  degree  of 

damage and increase the polishing rate. 

DMSRDE,  Kanpur  has  developed  a  chemical  mechanical  polishing  agent 

CEPSEL-86  for  planerizing  Silicon  Carbide  wafer  usinga  non-hazardous  and  non-

corrosive slurry for removal of SiC layer from silicon carbide substrates to planerize 

surface in large area for electronic applications.
