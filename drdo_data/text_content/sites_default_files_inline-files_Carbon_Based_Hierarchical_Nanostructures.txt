Processing and Manufacturing Technologies for Large Scale Preparation of

Carbon Based Hierarchical Nanostructures

To   perform   multiple   performance   objectives,   the   carbon-based   nanomaterial   needs   the

modifications. DMSRDE Kanpur has established a simple scalable process  for controlled site-

specific   functionalization   on   the   surface   of   different   low   dimensional.   The   selection   of

functional moieties to obtain multi functional nanomaterials is extremely critical to tailor the

physical   and   chemical   properties   compared   to   the   contemporary   materials.   Generally,   the

structure of carbon nanomaterials is highly stable and chemically inert, controlling the degree

of   surface  derivatization   of   nanotube   is   thus   remain   a  significant  challenge  to   achieve  the

desired properties. The number of functional groups on the surface of nanomaterials could be

restricted  by  optimizing   the  reaction  parameters  and  external   stimuli  however  the  different

aspect ratios in the material system make the task even more daunting. It is thus necessary to

follow   a   convenient   method   for   controlled   functionalization   of   nanostructures.  DMSRDE,

Kanpur  has  established  the  process  for   making  large  scaled  multi   functional   nanomaterials

where   the   position   and   degree   of   functionalization   were   preciously   controlled   for   desired

physical   and   chemical   properties.   An   increase   in   the   system-level   efficiency   and   multi

functionality of products and components is one of the main advantages of the use of these

specially designed materials and structures.
