RESTRICTED 

IMPULSE CARTRIDGE FOR CHAFF 118 

Chaff Cartridge 118 forms  part  of  a Counter  Measure  Deployment    System(CMDS)  

to protect the host air craft from Radar guided missile threats by providing a decoy (as chaff 

cloud). Chaff 118 consists of chaff payload to be ejected for , top cover, piston and impulse 

cartridge(IC).  The  impulse  Cartridge  contains  a  pyrotechnic  squib  charge  and  propellant, 

which when fired generates gas pressure to eject the chaff payload with ejection velocity 25-

50  m/s.  All  specified  parameters  like  No  Fire  Current  (NFC),  All  Fire  Current  (AFC), 

Ignition Delay and Pressures in a specified volume have been achieved. Chaff 118 is ready 

for the induction into services. In order to meet the large requirement of ICs,  TOT of these 

ICs  needs to be transferred to OFB/private industries.
