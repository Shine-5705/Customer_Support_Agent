Antifreeze coolants DAFC 30 and DAFC 50 

India is a large country where the ambient temperature varies from 490C at desert areas to 

extreme low i.e. below -300C on hills. Therefore a coolant is required for the engine cooling 
system of vehicles which should sustain in such a vast range of temperatures. So many coolants 
are available in the market at present but no one is found suitable to meet  in such a long range of 
change in climatic conditions. Keeping this in mind, DMSRDE has developed glycol based 
coolants DAFC 30 and DAFC 50 for this purpose.  

Special Features: I ) It is a glycol based antifreeze coolant, fortified with corrosion 

inhibitors. II) It is non reactive towards rubber parts in the system. III) It is also non corrosive 
towards metallic parts of the system. IV0 No further dilution is required. V) It is used as 
vehicles/radars coolant in plains and desert areas. VI) It is being  used in Indian Army.  

Scope: 

DAFC 30 can be used as a coolant in the engine cooling systems of cars trucks, heavy vehicles 
and auxiliary power units operating on plains up to -100C, on the other hand, DAFC 50 can be 
used  in  the  above  mentioned  engine  cooling  systems  operating  in  low  temperature  weather 
conditions up to -390C. it can be used without any further dilution.
