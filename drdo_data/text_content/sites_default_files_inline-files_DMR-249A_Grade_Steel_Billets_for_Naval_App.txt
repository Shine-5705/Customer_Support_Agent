“DMR-249A Grade Steel Billets for Naval Applications”

i. Description of the technology

Billets  are  rolled  product  having  rectangular  cross  section  manufactured  from  cast
ingots.  Billets  are  used  as  feedstock  to  manufacture  bulb  bars  by  rolling.  The
rectangular cross section of billets i.e. (width x thickness) ranges from minimum (80
x 100) mm to maximum(100 x 250) mm to serve as feedstock for smallest section
(P6) and largest section ( P24) of bulb bars respectively.

During  the  development,  DMRL  has  worked  in  close  coordination  with  the
manufacturing  agency 
towards  optimization  of  process  parameters.  DMRL
undertook  lead  role  towards  finalization  of  quality  assurance  plan,  which  has
ensured production and supply of billets with consistent and superior metallurgical
quality.

Billets  have  been  accepted  as  certified  feedstock  for  manufacture  of  bulb  bars  by
the user agencies.

ii. Application areas

The  billets  find  use  as  feedstock  to  manufacture  bulb  bars,  which  are  used  as
stiffeners in the construction of naval ships and submarines.

iii.Its USP-such as certifications and test results etc.

The  billets  for  bulb  bars  have  been  certified  for  use  in  both  surface  ships  and
submarines.
