DMR-249A Grade Steel Plates (thickness: 10 â€“ 20 mm) for Naval 
Applications 

i.  Description of the technology 

Technology  has  been  developed  for  manufacture  of  DMR249A  grade  steel 
plates, in thickness ranging from 10mm to 20mm, through controlled rolling and 
normalizing  (CR+N)  route  using  continuous  cast  slabs  as  feedstock.  During  the 
entire  course  of 
in  close 
coordination  with  the  manufacturing  agencies  for  establishing/optimizing  the 
process  parameters  to  ensure  robust  and  reliable  products,  which  met  the 
stringent dimensional, physical and metallurgical requirements.  

the  development,  DMRL  worked  extensively 

ii.  Application areas 

DMR249A  grade  steel  plates  find  use  in  the  construction  of  warships  including 
aircraft carriers.
