DMR-249A Grade Steel Plates (thickness: 21 â€“ 40 mm) for Naval 
Applications 

i.  Description of the technology 

Technology  has  been  developed  for  manufacture  of  DMR249A  grade  steel 
plates, in thickness ranging from 21mm to 40mm, through controlled rolling and 
Heat  treatment  (WQ+T)  route  using  continuous  cast  slabs  as  feedstock.  During 
the  entire  course  of  the  development,  DMRL  worked  extensively  in  close 
coordination  with  the  manufacturing  agencies  for  establishing/optimizing  the 
process  parameters  to  ensure  robust  and  reliable  products,  which  met  the 
stringent dimensional, physical and metallurgical requirements.  

ii.  Application areas 

DMR249A  grade  steel  plates  find  use  in  the  construction  of  warships  including 
aircraft carriers.  

The First Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC), INS Vikrant, one of 
the  first  major  applications,  has  used  WQ+T  plates  of 
DMR249A steel extensively
