DMR 249A Grade Steel Sheets (3.15 to 10mm) by Coil Route for Naval 

Applications 

i. 

Description of the technology 

Technology  has  been developed for manufacture  of  DMR249A  grade  steel  sheets,  in 
thickness ranging from 3.15 to 10mm, through hot rolled coiling route using continuous 
cast  slabs  as  feedstock.  During  the  entire  course  of  the  development,  DMRL  worked 
extensively 
for 
establishing/optimizing the process parameters to ensure robust and reliable products, 
which met the stringent dimensional, physical and metallurgical requirements.
