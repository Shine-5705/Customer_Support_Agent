DMR-249B Grade Steel Plates (08 â€“ 30 mm thick) for Naval 
Applications 

i.  Description of the technology 

Technology  has  been  developed  for  manufacture  of  DMR249B  grade  steel 
plates, in thickness ranging from 08mm to 30mm, through controlled rolling and 
Heat  treatment  (OQ+T  for  8-16mm  &  WQ+T  for  18-30mm)  route  using 
continuous cast slabs as feedstock. During the entire course of the development, 
DMRL worked extensively in close coordination with the manufacturing agencies 
for establishing/optimizing the process  parameters to ensure robust and reliable 
products,  which  met  the  stringent  dimensional,  physical  and  metallurgical 
requirements.  

ii.  Application areas 

DMR249B  grade  steel  plates  find  use  in  the  construction  of  warships  including 
aircraft carriers.  

Plates of DMR249B have been used for the flight deck of the First 
Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC), INS Vikrant
