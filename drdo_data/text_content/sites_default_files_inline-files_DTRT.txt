Digital Telemetry Receiver and Transmitter (DTRT) 

The  digital  telemetry  receiver  (DTR)  is  compliant  to  IRIG-106  standards  for  applications  in 
aeronautical  telemetry  links.  It  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  ground  telemetry  system  for  missile 
telemetry and satellite communication application right from assembly/ integration of the flight 
vehicle until the actual flight test. The DTR belongs to third generation receiver in the telemetry 
industry, in which it can interface the telemetry antenna with the display system, by performing 
all signal/ data processing operations using analog and digital hardware and firmware. The DTR 
is equipped with independent local oscillators for tuning. The down-converter outputs are band-
limited  using  filters  and  then  digitized  using  high-speed  ADC.  The  digitized  signals  are 
converted into equivalent, complex base-band representation, denoted as IQ signals, for further 
processing using DSP algorithms implemented on FPGA.  

Key Features 

•  Dual Channel RF and IF Receiver 
•  Trellis Detection for improved performance 
•  Diversity Combiner and Equalizer 
•  Convolutional, Demodulation and LDPC Decoding 
•  Frame Synchronization 
•  Telemetry over IP Support and In-built Telemetry Generator  
•  Supports display over Ethernet and HDMI 

The digital transmitter (DTX) is compliant with IRIG-106 standard and is suitable for air-borne 
applications.  The  data  rate,  carrier  frequency,  output  power  and  modulation  scheme  are 
configurable  by  user.  Advanced  features  like  FEC  encoding,  light-weight  etc  have  been 
implemented.  It  can  accept  variety  of  inputs  viz.,  unfiltered  PCM  stream,  filtered  PCM  stream 
and pass-band signal and configurable parameters like data rate, carrier frequency, output power 
and modulation scheme has been indigenously realized.
