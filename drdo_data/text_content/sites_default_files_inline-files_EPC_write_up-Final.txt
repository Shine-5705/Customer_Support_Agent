A brief description of Electronic Power Conditioner (EPC) 

A  MPM  comprises  a  solid-state  power  amplifier  (SSPA),  a  low-gain  short-length  travelling-wave  tube 
(TWT)  and  a  high-efficiency  compact  electronic  power  conditioning  (EPC)  housed  in  a  single  unit.  A  block 
schematic of a typical MPM is shown in Figure 1.  

One of the important elements of the MPM is an Electronic Power Conditioner (EPC), a power supply for 
vacuum electronic device (TWT) and a low voltage supply for the solid state power supply. The EPC is constituted 
with  high  efficiency  HV  converter  unit,  a  focus  electrode  modulator  unit  and  the  house-keeping  power  unit  apart 
from a microcontroller based MPM management unit. The HV converter delivers all the high voltage requirements 
of the cathode and depressed collectors of the TWT.

The management unit coordinates the sequencing, fault monitoring and protection mechanisms and also handles the 
command interface module. The HV converter has high density planar power transformer and high voltage ceramic 
capacitors  with  low  ESR,  ultrafast  recovery  diodes  etc  packaged  in  limited  volume  for  achieving  high  power 
conversion  density.  The  high  level  block  schematic  of  EPC  is  depicted  in  figure  2.  A  typical  EPC  assembled  in 
aluminium chassis is shown in figure 3.
