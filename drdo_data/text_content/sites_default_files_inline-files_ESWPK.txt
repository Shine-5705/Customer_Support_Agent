Emergency Sea Water Purification Kit 

Defence Laboratory Jodhpur has designed and developed an Emergency Sea Water
Purification Kit  (ESWPK)  for use in life rafts Indian Navy,  aircrafts and commando
operations. 

ESWPK unit comprise of design & fabrication, specific material synthesis and its
process   optimization,      experimental   studies,   developmental   trial   at   sea-shore
and   testing   certification   of   output   water   &   system   evaluation   procedures.   The
technology   based   on   specific   desalination   material   and   membrane   filter.  It   is
capable to convert Sea water (more than TDS 35000 ppm) into drinkable   water
(below TDS 500 ppm) with in short period   of   around  30 min. Kit is capable to
remove   colour,   odour,   turbidity,   high   TDS   and   microbial   contaminants   from   sea
water.   It   is   light   weight,   foldable,   simple   to   operate,   compact   and   no   need   of
electricity.

The   scope   of   technology   transfer   involves   specific   material   preparation   and   its
process optimization and membrane-based Emergency  Sea Water Purification  Kit
(ESWPK). An industry involved in the development /fabrication of membrane and
material-based Water Purification units/ other industries may express interest  for
Transfer of Technology (ToT) of ESWPK.
