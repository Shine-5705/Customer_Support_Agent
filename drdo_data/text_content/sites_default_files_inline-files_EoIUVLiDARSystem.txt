Summary: 
Laser is a  powerful technology for Homeland security in Defence as  well environmental sciences 
and medical sciences. In present scenario due to increased Bio-terrorist activities, threat to military 
personnel and civilians appears in the form of biological, chemical warfare agents and explosives. 
Minimizing the impact of such threats requires early detection of the presence of these hazardous 
agents  from  a  remote  or  standoff  safe  distance  as  well  as  point  distance.  Early  detection  and 
warning  systems  are  one  of  the  most  sought  after  gadgets  for  homeland  security.  Scattering  & 
Ultra  Violet  Laser  Induced  Fluorescence  (UV  LIF)  is  fast  emerging  as  potential  technique  for 
development of such systems for standoff detection of biological warfare agents. Standoff UV LIF 
technique is highly capable to detect any kind of bio-agents like Anthrax Bacillus in aerosol form, 
from ranges up to 1.0 kilometre.
