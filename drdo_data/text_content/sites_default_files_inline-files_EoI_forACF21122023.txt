Activated Carbon Fabric (ACF) 

Chemical  Warfare  Agents  (CWA)  are  man-made  highly  toxic  chemicals  that  are  fast  acting  on 
exposure  and  sometimes  lethal  even  at  low  levels.  Developing  lightweight  flexible  adsorbent 
material  can  open  the  window  for  the  development  of  lightweight,  comfortable  and  enhanced 
chemical  protective  ensemble  which  allows  the  first  responder  to  respond  swiftly  to  evolving 
threats in the field. Through extensive research, development and testing, Defence Research and 
Development  Establishment  (DRDE),  Gwalior  has  developed  Activated  Carbon  Fabric  (ACF),  an 
adsorbent material. ACF has many advantages over other commercial porous material in terms of 
adsorption capacity, well defined microporous structure, stability, flexibility and ease of lamination 
to various substrates. This material can be utilized in the NBC Suit and other protective ensembles 
as  an  adsorbent  layer.  The  developed  continuous  length  ACF  has  Tear  Strength  minimum  1  kg 
and  Surface  Area  >850  m2/g.  ACF  absorbs  the  toxic  chemicals  in  particular  gases  and  vapours 
when they come in contact at room temperature.
