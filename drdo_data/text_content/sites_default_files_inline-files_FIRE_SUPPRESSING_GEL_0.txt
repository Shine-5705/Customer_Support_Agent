FIRE SUPPRESSING GEL 

CFEES has indigenously developed  environment friendly Fire Suppressing Gel (FSG)

which   is   a  polymer-based   mixture   containing   fire   retardant   inorganic   material   with

swelling property in water. It sticks on burning objects, prevents the water from running

off or evaporating too quickly. By using FSG the extinguishment time and requirement

of water quantity is reduced and effectiveness of the applied water is increased by many

times. Also laying of FSG lanes may prevent further spreading of fire.

High   water   absorbing   FSG   is   synthesized   by   neutralizing   acrylic   acid.   After

neutralization   cross   linker   is   added   followed   by   addition   of   initiator.   At   suitable

temperature polymerization reaction initiates via free radical polymerization leading to

the formation of cross-linked sodium polyacrylate gel. Dried gel is then processed by

grinding and mixing inorganic fillers.
