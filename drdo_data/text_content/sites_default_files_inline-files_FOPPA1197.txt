Fabrication of Pilot Parachute Assembly, Part No. ADRDE/1197  

Pilot Parachute Assembly, Part No. ADRDE/1197 is a lifesaving equipment.  It is installed 
on  the  ejection  seat.  During  emergency/malfunctioning  of  aircraft,  pilot  pulls  the  firing 
handle which in turn activate the Emergency Escape System (EES). On activation of EES, 
main  canopy  is  pulled  out  of  seat  and  on  inflation  of  canopy,  it  brings  down  the  pilot 
safely on ground or water. Pilot parachute mainly consists of following subsystems: 

First stage drogue parachute sub system  
Second stage drogue parachute sub system 

(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)  Main Canopy 
(iv) 
Harness 

Pilot  parachute  system  is  fabricated  using  various  textile  materials  and  metal  parts.  The 
textile materials consist of fabrics, narrow fabrics (tapes and webbings), cordages. Majority 
of textile materials are made of Nylon6/ Nylon66 and few of Kevlar and Cotton. The metal 
parts  consist  of  buckles/lugs  made  of  ferrous  based  alloy  and  aluminum  based  alloy.  In 
order to fabricate the pilot parachute system firms, should have industrial sewing machines 
and  skilled  manpower  in  cutting/tailoring/stitching  of  textile  materials  including  Quality 
Assurance infrastructure.
