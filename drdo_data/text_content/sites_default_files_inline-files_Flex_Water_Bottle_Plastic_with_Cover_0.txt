FLEX WATER BOTTLE PLASTIC WITH COVER 

Water  Bottle  Plastic  with  cover  earlier  used  by  the  Army  to  keep  the  potable  water  during 

exercise in field area, is made of HDPE food grade quality. During itâ€™s use unpleasant odour 

was  felt  by  the  troops  when  potable  water  was  stored  in  these  bottle.  Cracks  were  also 

developed during use. 

To  obviate  these  problem  DMSRDE  has  developed  a  new  FLEX  WATER  BOTTLE 

PLASTIC  WITH  COVER  by  using  Polycarbonate  of  specific  grade  which  is  able  tp 

overcome  the  above  problems.  It  has  higher  impact  resistance  ,  light  weight  in  1  liter 

capacity. Flex Water Bottle Plastic with cover is an inducted store in Indian Army. The bottle 
is  able  to  last  longer  in  all  environmental  conditions  (-40  O  C  to  100  O  C).  It  can  hold  the 

water  for  prolonged  duration  in  original  condition  without  odour.  Due  to  excellent 

mechanical and thermal properties life of the developed water bottle is much more than the 

existing water bottle. A sipper has also been designed and mounted on the mouth of the bottle 

for easy drinking. The cover of the developed water bottle has been designed and fabricated 

by  using  Nylon  fabric  PU  coated  disruptive  pattern  with  Acrylic  pile  fabric  insulation  

followed by netting fabric for more insulation in order to maintain the original condition of 

the item in the bottle for longer duration.
