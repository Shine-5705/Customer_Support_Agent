HAPO CHAMBER 

HAPO chamber is a life saving device that provides emergency treatment to HAPO 

(High  Altitude  Pulmonary  Oedema),  a  condition  characterized  by  breathlessness, 

tachycardia,  tachypnoea,  mild  fever  and  cough,  beside  blood-stained  sputum  & 

accumulation  of  fluids  in  lungs.  HAPO  is  rapidly  fatal  if  not  attended  immediately.  It 

works  on  the  principle  of  increasing  the  atmospheric  pressure  around  the  patient 

thereby  simulating  descent  in  altitude  by  about  6,000-8,000  ft  AMSL  in  a  controlled 

manner.
