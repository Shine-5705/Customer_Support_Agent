HIGH EXPLOSIVE COMPOSITION FOR THEWARHEAD(HL-W007) 

Two types of warheads to be used in two different modes, namely; PFwarhead to 

defeat radiating targets such as radars etc and PCB warhead to neutralize moderately 

protected built up targets like bunkers / concrete targets etc.  

The  PF  warhead  consists  of  a  kill  mechanism  which  comprises  of  a  metallic 

casing in which preformed fragments are embedded in a resin matrix. On detonation of 

the  warhead,  fragments  are  ejected  out  with  high  velocity  which  penetrates  into  the 

target  and  cause  the  requisite  damages.  The  PCB  warhead  is  designed  to  cause 

damages to moderately  protected  targets such as bunkers etc. PCB  warhead consists 

of  impact  delay  fuze  which  enables  the  warhead  to  function  after  penetrating  a 

moderately  protected  target.  On  detonation,  the  internal  blast  and  the  natural 

fragmentation cause required damages to the protected targets. 

The  processing  and  characterization  of  these  warhead  compositionshave 

beenfully established and it is ready for ToT.
