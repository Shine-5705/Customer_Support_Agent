Brief write-up on HEMCENE Technology 

4-Dimethylsilyl  Butyl  Ferrocene  Grafted  Hydroxy  Terminated  Polybutadiene 

(HEMCENE) is a potential burn rate catalyst proven to be used for special purpose high burning 

rate rocket propellants. HEMCENE is advantageous in many respects over the conventional solid 

and liquid burn rate catalysts.Apart from significant catalytic effect to enhance burn rate of solid 

rocket  propellants,  HEMCENE  eliminates  issues  related  to  processing  and  migration  during 

storage.  Further,  structural  similarity  with  HTPB  binder  makes  it  compatible  with  other 

ingredients used in composite propellant.  

To  address  the  sustained  requirement  of  HEMCENE  for  various  projects  of  DRDO, 

HEMRL has developed a bench scale process technology. The present method for preparation of 

HEMCENE  is  a  three  step  process  that  includes  total  five  reactions  namely  Acylation, 

Reduction,  Grignard,  Silylation  and  Grafting.  All  the  three  steps  are  optimized  for  mole  ratio, 

temperature, time and product isolation. The final product HEMCENE is obtained as a dark red 

thick liquid polymeric material.At present, the process for HEMCENE is realized at 1-2 kg/batch 

levelwithyield of ~75%. The properties of HEMCENE developed in this process meets desired 

specification w.r.t %Fe, Molecular weight, Viscosity etc. required for end applications. 

In  order  to  meet  the  futuristic  bulk  requirementto  the  tune  of  few  tons  per  annum  for 

various DRDO programs, it is planned to transfer the technology to suitable industry partners for 

production  of  HEMCENE.  In  view  of  this,  Expression  of  Interest  is  invited  from  interested 

industrial partners for ‘Transfer of Technology’ of HEMCENE.
