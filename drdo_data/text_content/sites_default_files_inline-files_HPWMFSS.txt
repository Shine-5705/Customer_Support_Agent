High Pressure Water Mist Fire Suppression System (HP WMFSS) 

High  pressure  single  fluid  water  mist  fire  suppression  technology  has  been  accepted 

worldwide for its fire extinguishment and thermal management capabilities. This technology 

generates very fine water droplets which produces a very large heat collecting surface area 

and  rapidly  reduce  the  temperature  of  the  combustion  zone  and  air  in  the  space.  As  the 

water droplets convert into vapour, it dilutes the oxygen concentration leading to smothering 

of fire.  Water mist does not require spaces to be sealed or evacuated and can be deployed 

in  manned  spaces.  The  mist  acts  in  several  ways  to  fight  fire  but  can  also  be  used  to 

prevent flashovers and pre-emptively cool compartments.
