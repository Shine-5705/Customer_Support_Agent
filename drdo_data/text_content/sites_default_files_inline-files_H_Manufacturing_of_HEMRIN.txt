Manufacturing of HEMRIN-EPDM based insulation system for Solid Rocket Motors 

The Solid rocket propellant motor consists of about 80% by weight of energetic propellant, 
vital  for  rocket  propulsion.  The  motor  requires  various  other  inert  sub  system  for  satisfactory 
performance.  Insulation  system  is  one  of  the  most  important  subsystems  for  harnessing  the 
predicted  performance  characteristics  of  a  rocket  motor. The  major  criteria  of  this  system  in  case 
bonded rocket motors are low density, low thermal conductivity, low erosion rate, good mechanical 
properties and excellent bonding characteristics. 

EPDM  based  insulation  system  is  globally  used  in  present  day  rocket  motors  and  space 
shuttles  because  of  its  advantages  like  low  specific  gravity,  superior  thermal  characteristics, 
improved low temp flexibility and wider range of compounding choices to reduce specific gravity. 
The most important property from defence application point of view is the long shelf life of the pure 
polymer. 

Keeping  the  required  characteristics  in  view,  an  insulation  system  for  case  bonded  solid 
rocket motors based on Ethylene propylene diene rubber (EPDM) was developed at HEMRL under 
a Technology Demonstration project. 

Low density (1.04-1.09 g/cc), very low erosion rate (0.06-0.09 mm/s) and excellent thermal, 
mechanical  and  interface  properties  were  achieved  with  the  developed  insulation  system.  The 
insulation system is currently being used in most of the Indian defence rocket and missiles.
