HEATED GLOVES  

The  Heated  Gloves  with  protection  control  module  (PCM)  have  been  designed  to  meet  the 
stringent  requirements  of  extreme  cold  weather-high  altitude  conditions  and  provide 
protection  up  to  -30°C  and  heat  up  automatically  when  temperature  drops  below  20°C  and 
maintains the temperature within physiological comfort.  The current from the Lithium Ion 
battery  source  to  the  heating  filaments  in  the  glove  has  been  intelligently  controlled  and 
preserved  using  electronic  controller  unit  (ECU).  The  rechargeable  batteries  provide  power 
for  about  6-7  hours  of  continuous  heating.  Airworthiness  certificate  accorded  by  RCMA 
(A/C).
