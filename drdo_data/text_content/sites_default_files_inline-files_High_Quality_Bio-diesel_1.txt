BRIEF WRITE UP ON TECHNOLOGY 

DIBER, DRDO Technology for Deriving High Quality Bio-diesel Meeting Specified Indian 
Standards (IS:15607) from Jatropha (Superior Germplasm) 

Bio-diesel Scenarion in India: Gaps and Challenges 

Jatropha curcas is a mandated crop for bio diesel production in India (National Biofuel 
Policy  2008,  National  Policy  on  Biofuels  2018).  However,  early  entrepreneurs  have  struck 
with failure due to following reasons-  
  Lack of quality feedstock and Agrotechnology practices  
  Lack of oil extraction and transesterification technologies producing bio-diesel meeting 

IS15607 standards.  

  Cumbersome post processing procedures.  
  Short shelf life.  

Superior DIBER Technologies Overcoming Existing Shortcomings 

Rigorous  research  efforts  by  this  Institute  have  led  to  development  of  an  overall 
model for deriving bio diesel from Jatropha with attractive gains. A list of sub-technologies is 
as under-  

Technology/ Product 

a)  High yielding varieties of Jatropha curcas 

b)  Tissue  culture  mediated  mass  propagation 

protocol 

c)  Area specific Agrotechnology 

d) 

(Semi-arid, foothills, North-West Himalayas) 
Indigenous  oil  extraction  and  transesterification 
technologies for production of bio-diesel meeting 
IS:15607 standard.  

e)  Range  of  value  added  products-  soap,  glycerine, 
fuel  briquettes,  fertilizer  reducing  the  overall 
production cost.
