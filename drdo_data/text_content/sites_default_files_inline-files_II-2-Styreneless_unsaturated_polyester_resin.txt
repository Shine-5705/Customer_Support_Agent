Styrene less unsaturated polyester resin
NMRL has developed special polyester resin for adhering special rubber article onto metal
surface. Unlike conventional polyester resin where the diluent is styrene, the polyester resin
is a solution of unsaturated polyester in dimethacrylate. The final usage of resin is in the
curable form which is done under electron beam irradiation. The qualitative requirement of
resin included transparent liquid, curable under EB treatment as per specification,
reasonable pot life and easy applicability. The resin is formulated in such a way that it gives
optimum performance without failing in adhesion along with epoxy putty when the
adhered structure is used underwater. The advantage of this resin over commercial resin is
that it is styreneless, nontoxic and excellent storage life.
