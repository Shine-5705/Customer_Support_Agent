NMR- IRP1075 Rubber Sheet  

Sound Insulation Coatings (SIC) are used in submarines for suppression of submarine 
self noise from getting transmitted outside the outer hull.  SIC is fabricated by covering 
the perforated side of 51mm thick acoustic with plain rubber sheet which prevents water 
ingress in to the acoustic tile. NMRL has developed the rubber compound for the plain 
rubber  sheet  (IRP1075)  for  application  on  SIC.  The  major  requirement  of  the  plain 
rubber sheet is high strength, high rubber to rubber adhesion.  

Salient Features: 

  Physical  appearance  –  Vulcanised  rubber  sheet  with  fabric  impression  on  one 

side 

  Size of rubber sheet – 4.1m x 800mm x 4mm thickness 
  Application – by adhesive bonding 
  Good tensile strength and sea water resistance 
  Good rubber to rubber bond strength 
  Can be made using conventional rubber processing machinery 

Area of application:  

  Used for fabrication of Sound Insulation Coating in submarines
