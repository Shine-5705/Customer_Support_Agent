NMR- IRP1074 Rubber Sheet  

Vibro  Damping  Coating  (VDC)  is  a  multilayer  sandwich  structure  for  use  in  submarine 
decks  and  engine  rooms  for  suppressing  the  structural  vibration  arising  from  the 
operation  of  onboard  machinery.  The  VDC  is  fabricated  by  adhering  multiple  layers 
(typically  3  layer)  of  rubber  sheet  (IRP1074)  and  sandwiching  the  multilayer  rubber 
structure  between  base  structure  and  constraining  layer.  The  top  constraining  layer  is 
applied onto the rubber layer by adhesive and the sandwich structure is bonded to the 
base by mechanical bolting.
