Low Density Ablative Material (LDAM) 

1. 
Low  Density  Ablative  Material  (LDAM)  has  been  developed  by  DRDL  for  missile 
application. LDAM can be used as internal/external thermal protection for putty application 
and  for  sealing  joints  in  missile  systems.  This  type  of  insulation  system  which  has  the 
advantages  over  the  existing  insulation  systems  such  as  PC-10,  TPP/TPI,  EPDM  and 
ROCASIN  in  terms  of  density,  ease  of  application  repairable,  high  thermal  stability  and 
applicable  to  both  metallic  and  composite  sections.  LDAM  has  shown  good  structural 
integrity for handling, transportation and repairing works. 

2. 
LDAM  can  be  applied  both  externally/  internally  by  spraying  as  per  the  thickness 
requirement on metallic and non- metallicsurfaces both.  It can also be applied as  Putty for 
sealing joints.  It can be coated into any shape and thickness as per the requirements. 

Salient features of LDAM are as follows: 

  Very low density. 
  Low thermal Conductivity. 
  Thermal stability up to 1200o C 
  Room Temperature Curable 
  Green process 
  No by products in the process 
  Tailor made for different type of shapes and applications
