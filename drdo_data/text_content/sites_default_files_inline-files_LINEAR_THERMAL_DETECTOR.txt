LINEAR THERMAL DETECTOR 

Linear Thermal detector is being used to detect the over heat and fire condition in engine

compartment of Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) and aerospace application. Till date it

is being imported and contributes the major cost in fire detection and suppression system.

CFEES has developed Linear thermal detector to detect overheat and fire condition in Engine

compartment of Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs). Linear thermal detector is a coaxial

cable in which negative temperature coefficient material is filled between outer sheath and

central conductor. It provides overheat warning and actuates fire extinguisher in case of fire

in engine compartment of AFVs 

Materials for outer  sheath, central  conductor and material to be filled between outer and

central conductor has been identified and fabrication process of linear thermal detector has

been devised. Fabrication process includes filling of NTC material between hollow tube and

centre conductor, drawing & annealing.

Design  and  development   of   linear   thermal   detector  having  â‰¤   2.5mm   outer   diameter   and

20feet   length   has   been   carried   out.  Testing   and   evaluation   of   prototype   has   been   done

successfully.   Linear   thermal   detector   qualified   environmental   tests   as   per   JSS55555.

Resistance between outer sheath and inner conductor decreases with increase in temperature.

Cost   of   indigenously   developed   linear   thermal   detector   will   be  lesser   as   compared   to

imported one. Linear thermal detector can be used for aviation application also to detect the

fire in engine. It can also be used to detect the fire in civil vehicles as well as in process

plants coupled with fire fighting system.
