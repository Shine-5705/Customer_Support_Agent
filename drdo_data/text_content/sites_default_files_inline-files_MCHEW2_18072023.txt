Expression of Interest (EoI) for ToT of High Explosive Technology for Warhead (MCHEW-2) of 
Missile System 

Description of Technology: 
There was a need to develop high explosive technologies for the PCB and BF type of warheads to 
destroy various targets.  

i.  HE technology for penetration cum blast warhead  
ii.  HE technology for blast fragmentation warhead  
iii.  HES compositions for Inert warhead  

High  explosive  technology  has  been  developed  by  DRDO  to  destroy  various  targets.  Exhaustive 
studies were carried out to finalize the HE compositions and their filling methodologies in warhead to 
realize the required performance lethality at the desired distances. The melt cast technology has been 
developed for the main filling of the warhead and pressing technology for the booster charge.   

More  powerful  main  filling  of  high  VoD  HE  composition  has  been  finalized  for  the  Blast 
Fragmentation  (BF)  warhead.  High  shock  insensitive  composition  has  been  finalized  for  the 
Penetration cum blast warhead (PCB). Booster pellets are of  HE composition (PBXP 101). They are 
developed for completion of explosive train  

HE casting in two types of warheads viz. penetration cum blast (PCB) and blast fragmentation (BF) 
has been completed. All trials such as integration checks, static performance trials, controlled dynamic 
trials  of  warheads  for  design  validation  are  completed  successfully.  Developed  high  explosive 
composition met QR. 

Application Areas: 
High explosive compositions and their filling in warhead of MCHEW-2 is designed and developed by 
DRDO to destroy various targets by blast fragmentation and penetration cum blast.  

Unique Selling Point (USP): 
All  the  trials  including  User  trials  of  warhead  in  both  static  and  flight  modes  have  been  completed 
successfully. Developed technology met QR and it is equivalent to global level. All the raw materials 
for  the  filling  of  warhead  system  are  available  indigenously.  The  equipment  required  for  the 
preparation of explosive composition filling is available indigenously.
