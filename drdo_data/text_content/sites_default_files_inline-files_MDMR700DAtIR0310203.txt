Manufacture of DMR-1700 Steel forgings, forged feedstock and mill forms (sheets and plates) 
for Defence Applications through ingot route 

DMR-1700  steel  is  the  result  of  a  comprehensive  and  fundamental  study  undertaken  at  DMRL, 
Hyderabad  over  a  period  of  nearly  two  decades  to  develop  a  low  cost  alternative  to  250  grade 
maraging steel (total alloy content ~ 30-35 %) for defence applications. Extensive research led to the 
optimization  of  alloy  design  and  understanding  of  physical  metallurgy  of  the  steel  to  achieve  an 
excellent combination of ultra high strength and high fracture toughness at room temperature.  

The industrial production of steel plates through ingot metallurgical route showed promising defence 
applications. The steel was produced into forgings, forged feedstock and mill (sheet and plate) forms 
through ingot route followed by hot forging, hot rolling and heat treatment. The steel plates of higher 
thicknesses  were  quenched  and  tempered  whereas  low  thicknesses  (<  10  mm)  plates  can  be  air 
hardenable.  The  forgings  and  forged  feedstock  was  used  for  successful  subsequent  manufacturing 
processes  to  realize  some  of  the  components  being  used  for  defence  applications.  All  the  plates 
showed mechanical properties meeting the specified values for various defence applications.
