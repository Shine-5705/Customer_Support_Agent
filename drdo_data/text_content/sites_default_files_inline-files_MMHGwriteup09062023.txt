MULTI MODE HAND GRENADE (MMHG) 

The  Multi  Mode  Hand  Grenade  (MMHG)  developed  by  TBRL  has  been  designed  with  positive 
safeties and to get reliable performance. MMHG can be used in two modes - Offensive mode & Defensive 
mode. The two modes can be changed easily before throwing from one to another by removing/applying 
fragmenting sleeve. MMHG consists of two modules i.e. Fuze & Main Body. With the help of two modules it 
is very easy to prime & un-prime the Fuze & Main Body without sacrificing the efficiency.  

APPLICATION OF TWO MODES GRENADE: 

Defensive Mode: This  mode  is  used  for  defence  when  thrower  is  in  shelter  and  enemy  is  in  open  field. 
This  mode  of  MMHG  is  complete  grenade  with  fragments.  The  lethality  area  is  more  in  this  mode  as 
compared to offensive mode.  

Offensive Mode: This mode is used when thrower in attacking mode. This mode does not have fragments 
as fragmenting sleeve is removed in this mode. This is having only stunning effects.  

SALIENT FEATURE 
  Modular design 
  Multi-Mode & Light weight  
  Uniform fragmentation pattern with higher density 
  Additional thrower safety (Safety Release Delay Mechanism) 
  High Reliability  and Shelf Life  
  Maintenance free 

OPERATIONAL CHARACTERSTICS: 
  Convenient to handle and use.  
  Safe for Para-dropping in primed condition. 
  Additional  Thrower  safety  through  arming  delay  of  minimum  0.5  second.  The  Fuze  has  functional 
delay of 3.5 to 4.5 seconds for detonation after release. (The ToT seeking industry has to develop pyro 
compositions and it’s filling methodologies to meet the string requirements of Indian Army for Arming 
& Functioning of grenade).  

  Operational & Storage Temperature Range is -20 to +55°C.  
  Not affected by rain or humidity when exposed for short duration.
