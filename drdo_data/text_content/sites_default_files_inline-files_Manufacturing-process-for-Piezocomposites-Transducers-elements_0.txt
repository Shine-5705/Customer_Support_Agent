Manufacturing process for Piezocomposites Transducers elements 

PZT-Polymer Composite (Piezocomposite) elements and linear arrays for advanced 
sonar transducers have been developed by NMRL, as a high promise alternative for 
conventionally  used  PZT  piezoceramic  material  having  the  limitations  like  high 
acoustic  impedance,  higher  weight  factor  and  poor  mechanical  properties.  The 
Piezocomposite  based  sonar 
receiving  and 
transmitting response over a large frequency bandwidth and narrow beamwidth.
