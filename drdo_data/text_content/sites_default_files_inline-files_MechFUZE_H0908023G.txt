MECHATRONIC FUZE FOR (HAND) GRENADE 

DRDO lab TBRL, Chandigarh has developed Mechatronic Fuze which is an  electrochemical fuze 
that  combines  the  benefits  of  rugged  and  more  reliable  mechanical  safeties  and  functional 
operations  and  timing  accuracy  of  the  electronics.  The  fuze  is  designed  for  hand  grenade 
applications  and  operates  in  three  modes  Viz.  Time  delay,  Impact  and  Dual.  Pre-launch  safeties 
have been provided through mechanical components whereas post launch safeties and intelligence 
have incorporated using embedded system based electronic hardware and software. The detonator is 
misaligned  with  the  rest  of  the  explosive  train  during  storage  and  transportation.  The  Fuze  is 
powered by COTS primary lithium battery. 

When the grenade is thrown safety lever flies off and the battery is activated providing power to the 
electronic  circuitry.  Simultaneously  the  detonator  gets  aligned  with  the  explosive  train.  If  the 
grenade  touches  the  ground  before  specified  time  or  accidental  drop  safety  is  activated  and  the 
grenade is neutralized otherwise the grenade operates as per the selected mode. The time delay of 
the fuze is factory programmable. If because of any reason the grenade did not function the batter is 
discharged  to  neutralize  the  grenade  did  not  function  the  battery  is  discharged  to  neutralize  the 
grenade permanently.
