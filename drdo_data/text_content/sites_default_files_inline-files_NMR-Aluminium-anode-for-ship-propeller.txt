NMR-Aluminium anode for ship propeller  
(NMR-AASP) 

Introduction  

The  present  invention  is  on  the  development  of  sacrificial  anodes  with  low  driving 
potential and is particularly useful for fitment to the propeller in manner such that the 
potential drop between propeller and cathodically protected ship hull is close to zero 
thereby reducing potential difference between the anode / hull and the propeller and 
hence the UEP/ SR signatures and also the ELFE signatures.  

Salient Features  

Aluminium alloy anode  
The Indium free aluminiun alloy anode has the following features: 
i. Open circuit potential  
ii. Closed circuit potential  
iii. Current capacity 

:    -820  to -840 m V vs SCE  
:    -800 to -820  m V vs SCE 
:     min   2400 Ahr/Kg 

The anodes are available in different shape and size, so that anodes can be selected as 
per  requirement  of  the  user.    Also  the  anodes  are  designed  to  give  maximum  current 
output. 

Application Areas 
Corrosion protection of ship Propellers and reduction of ELFE signatures 

Present Status: Technology available for ToT.
