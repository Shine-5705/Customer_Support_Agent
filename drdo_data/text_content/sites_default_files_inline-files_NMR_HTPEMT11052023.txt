High Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Nanocomposite Membrane Technology 
(NMR-HTPEMT)  

Polymer electrolyte membrane is the heart of a fuel cell which is an electrochemical 
device  that  converts  chemical  energy  into  electrical  energy  from  the  reaction 
between  Hydrogen  and  oxygen/air.  The  role  of  the  membrane  is  to  transport  the 
protons  generated  at  the  anode  to  the  cathode  to  complete  the  electrochemical 
reaction. It also performs the function of a separator between the two electrodes. To 
fulfil  the  criteria  of  an  electrolyte  the  membrane  should  possess  excellent  thermo-
mechanical properties coupled with high proton conductivity. 

NMRL,  Ambernath  has  developed  a  nanocomposite  polybenzimidazole  based 
membrane (Indian patent applied) for application in HTPEMFC and realized a 100W 
stack  using  the  same.  The  membrane  is  made  from  indigenously  available 
precursors.  The  membrane  possesses  high  thermo-mechanical  stability  and  has 
excellent  chemical  resistance  coupled  with  high  proton  conductivity  on  doping  with 
phosphoric acid. Since it does not require water for conduction, it is most suitable for 
fuel  cell  operation  in  the  temperature  range  of  120-180°C.  In-house  studies  have 
demonstrated a high endurance under accelerated fuel cell conditions. 

It  is  also  useful  as  a  separator  for  battery  and  a  solid  polymer  electrolyte  for  high 
temperature supercapacitors.
