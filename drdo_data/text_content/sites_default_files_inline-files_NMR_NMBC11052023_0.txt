NANO-MATERIAL BASED COATING FOR BILGES (NMR-NMBC) 

NMRL,  Ambernath  has  developed  anticorrosive  epoxy  coating  is  developed  for 

application  in  bilge  areas  of  naval  ships.  It  is  a  direct  to  metal  coating.  It  tolerates 

surface  dampness,  oil,  grease,  rust  and  pre-existing  coatings  as  the  surface 

contaminants.  The  paint  composition  is  thixotropic  in  nature  and  provides  a  dry  film 

thickness about 250 micron in a single coat.  

The  essential  ingredients  of  this  paint  are  epoxy  resin,  curing  agents,  reactive 

diluent  and  nano  and  micron  size  pigments  and  fillers.  It  also  consists  of  specialty 

additives  for  adhesion  promotion,  thixotropy,  wetting,  dispersing  and  defoaming.  This 

paint  can  be  prepared  using  combination  of  ultrasonicator,  high  speed  disperser  and 

triple roll mill. It has two hours pot life. It cures to form a hard and tough barrier coating 

to  protect  the  substrates  in  contact  with  bilge  water  (mixture  of  seawater  and  oil).  For 

application of this paint, there is no need of dry docking of the ship. 

Salient features of coating 

  Excellent adhesion on wet, oily, rusted and pre-

existing paints 

  Direct to metal coating 
  Excellent corrosion resistance 
  Excellent water, alkali and oil resistance 
  Good flow, leveling and no brush marks  
  Higher flexibility and impact strength
