Development of Fe-TiC composites by SHS (NMR-SHS) Technology 

A  new  innovative  method  for  preparation  of  Fe-TiC  composite  material  by  SHS 

technology has been adopted & established at NMRL. In this process, TiC  formation 

is  in-situ  during  SHS  reaction  and  thereby  provides  formation  of  finer  particles  with  a 

cleaner  particle/metal  interface  compared  to  conventional  metal-ceramic  composite 

materials  made  by  powder  metallurgical  techniques  using  separate  metal-ceramic 

powders  in  ex-situ  manner.  The  processing  time  is  also  very  short  to  the  tune  of  few 

seconds compared to hours to days in the case of powder metallurgy techniques. This 

rapid  reaction  SHS  processing  is  basically  an  intelligent  way  of  utilizing  high  heat 

release  of  exothermic  reactions  through  direct  aluminothermic  reduction  of  less 

expensive oxides of iron and titanium. With suitable addition of carbon & flux, the molten 

Fe-TiC MMC can be directly cast into near net shapes.
