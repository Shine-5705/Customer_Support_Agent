Nuclear Shielding Pads for Combat vehicles 

Nuclear  explosion  give  rise  to  immediate  threat  of  blast,  heat  and  INR  (initial  nuclear 
radiation)  besides  the  delayed  threat  of  fallout  radiation  /  contamination.  Initial  Nuclear 
Radiation (INR) is the radiation emitted within the first minute of nuclear explosion of nuclear 
fast  neutrons.  The  other 
weapon.  This  consists  of  high-energy  gamma  rays  and 

accompanying  radiations  alpha’s  and  beta’s  are  all  absorbed  within  the  near  vicinity  of 
explosion. Primary gamma rays are best shielded with lead or high-density materials. Fast 
neutrons  are  more  effectively  shielded  by  hydrogen.  Therefore,  hydrogen  contents  are 
maximized in polymer matrix of composite shielding materials. The fast neutrons are slowed 

down  to  thermal energies  by  collision  with  hydrogen  atoms.  The heavy  atoms  such  as lead 
will also slow down, fast neutrons by inelastic scattering.  

Fallout  Radiation  or  residual  radiation  emitted  later  than  one  minute  after  the  explosion  of 
nuclear weapon. Fallout from a high air burst practically negligible. It is mainly occurs in the 
case of ground burst or low air burst. Secondary gamma rays having energy of 2.2 Mev are 
created as a result of collision of fast neutrons with hydrogen atoms. It can be minimized by 

adding  boron  or  lithium.  Gamma  rays  resulting  from  capture  of  thermal  neutrons  by  boron 
have energy of only 0.42 Mev which reduces the overall dosage considerably.
