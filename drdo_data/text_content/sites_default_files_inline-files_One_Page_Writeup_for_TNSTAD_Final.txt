1,4,5,8  tetranitroso-1,4,5,8-tetraazadecalin  (TNSTAD)  is  an  off-white  high  energy 

material having molecular weight of 258 g/mol. It is a potential energetic compound 

for low flame temperature and high force constant gun propellants attributed by its 

properties  like  high  nitrogen  content,  low  oxygen  balance  and  generation  of  large 

number of low molecular weight fractions upon initiation. Further, it has properties 

like  high  impact  insensitivity  compared  to  conventional  compound  used  in  gun 

propellant.  The  potential  use  of  TNSTAD  can  also  be  explored  in  Fin  Stabilized 

Armor  Piercing  Discarding  Sabot  (FSAPDS)  and  other  composite  propellant 

formulations.  

High  Energy  Materials  Research  Laboratory  (HEMRL)  under  the  Defence  Research 

and  Development  Organization  (DRDO)  has  developed  the  technology  for 

preparation  of  TNSTAD.  Preparation  of  TNSTAD  is  a  two  step  process  involving 

cyclisation  and  nitrosation  reaction.  The  process  of  preparation  of  TNSTAD  is 

optimised with respect to various parameters like reaction time, mole ratio, reaction 

temperature,  strength  of  acid  etc.  TNSTAD  thus  prepared  is  characterised  with 

respect to different properties like decomposition temperature, ash content, particle 

size distribution, impact sensitivity etc.. There is large requirement of this explosive.
