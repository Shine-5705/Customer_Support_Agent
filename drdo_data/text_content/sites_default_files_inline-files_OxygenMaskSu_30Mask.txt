POSITIVE PRESSURE BREATHING OXYGEN MASK (Su-30 Mask) 

The   use   of   specific   Protective   Equipment   and   Flying   Clothing   by   a   Fighter

Pilot is mission oriented and the importance of providing light weight solutions to

enhance   long   endurance   missions   is   widely   acknowledged.   Pressure   breathing

Oxygen mask is one of the critical flying clothing products developed under Design

and Development of Advanced Aeromedical Life support   products (ALSP) to meet

specific requirements of the Users’ operating Fighter Aircrafts. Mask is essentially a

life   saving  device  catering  to  controlled  breathing  requirements  at   high  altitudes

and hence the item has to be retained in the head gear and should not lift beyond a

limit to prevent exposure of eyes to wind blast test conditions when subjected to

the effects of air friction during the process of ejection. Thus, the retention of the

Mask is of paramount importance to ensure the safety and survival of the Pilot.

DEBEL has designed and developed state of art Positive pressure breathing

Oxygen Mask for Pilots operating Su30, MiG 29, MiG 29K, Bison& Mirage Aircraft and

has  met  various MiL and  Def. standards  including the  wind  blast  test cleared  by

RCMA(A/C) for 600 KEAS. The item has undergone extensive User trials.
