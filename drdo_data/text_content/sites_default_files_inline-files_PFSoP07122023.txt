A PROCESS FOR SYNTHESIS OF POLYCARBOSILANE 

The  scientific  and  technological  developments  with  the  objective  of  betterment  and 
safety of human life require several classes of materials ranging from materials that are 
highly  temperature  and  environment  sensitive  to  the  materials  that  are  exceptionally 
stable  under  extreme  environments.  The  most  stable  materials  under  extreme 
temperature  and  oxidative  environments  are  undoubtedly  ceramics.  Ceramics  can  be 
broadly  divided  into  oxide  ceramics  and  non-oxide  ceramics.  Contrary  to  non-oxide 
ceramics  most  of  the  oxide  ceramics  tend  to  loose  mechanical  strength  beyond  1000 
degree  centigrade.  For  structural  applications  beyond  1000  degree  centigrade  under 
oxidative environments like, gas turbine engines, rockets, missiles and nuclear reactors, 
silicon  carbide  ceramic  based  components  are  highly  preferred.  This  is  due  to 
exceptionally  high  thermal  stability,  corrosion  and  erosion  resistance,  low  thermal 
expansion  coefficient  and  very  good  thermo-oxidative  stability  of  silicon  carbide. 
Conventional  route  for  processing  of  SiC  components  is powder  processing  but  it  has 
limitation  in  making  complicated  and  fine  dimension  products  like  fibers,  films  and 
coatings.  An  alternative  route  that  enables  processing  of  complicated  products  at 
relatively lower temperatures is polymer precursor derived ceramic technology.  

Among  various  polymeric  precursors  of  SiC,  polycarbosilane  is  most  explored  one. 
DMSRDE  had  developed  process  for  synthesis  of  polycarbosilane  to  fulfil  the 
requirement of suitable precursor polymer for SiC based products like, fibers, foams and 
rearrangement  of 
composites.  Synthesis  process 
polydimethylsilane up to 450 degree centigrade under strict inert atmosphere. Process 
for  synthesis  of  polycarbosilane  has  been  established  using  glass  reaction  set  up  as 
well as metallic reactor.
