Propellant & Igniter for Booster and Sustainer Motors of  

Short Range Anti Ship Missile 

The  propulsion  system  of  Short  range  anti  ship  missile  consists  of  two  motors,  a 

booster motor and a sustainer motor.  

The  propellants  for  both  the  motors  are  solid  composite  propellants.  The  propellant 

for  Sustainer  motor  is  a  case  bonded  reduced  smoke  composite  propellant  and  the 

configuration is end burning mode. Whereas, for booster motor, the propellant is case bonded 

high burn rate propellant in star configuration. 

Torch shaped metallic canister  mounted on  the adapter  of  the  head end lid  has  been 

designed and developed for booster Motor.The sustainer igniter is assembled in the rear end 

of  the  motor.  The  igniter  composition  for  both  is  boron  based  pyrotechnic  composition  in 

pellet form. Both the igniters have flash holes for communication of flame from igniter to the 

propellant surface and are initiated by pyros. 

The  technology  for  processingof  propellant  and  igniters  is  fully  established  by 

HEMRL and the performance has been successfully demonstrated in various trials. 

Now  this  technology  is  completely  matured  and  the  same  can  be  transferred  to 

production agencies for further requirements.
