Propellant and Igniter for HL-P007 

This system is fired from fighter aircraft and it consists of propellant and igniter.The 

propellant  used is composite  propellant.  The  propellant  developed  for  motor  is  high  energy 

propellant cast as a solid grain. This developed propellant provides the desired total impulse 

requirement, and hence the required range, speed and manoeuvrability to the system.  

The igniter consists of two parts namely metallic igniter canister, igniter closure and 

canister liner. The igniter charge mass and pellets are designed to meet the desired propulsion 

requirement.
