Processing and Material Technologies of Shear Thickening Gel Based 
Nanocomposites for Impact Resistant Applications 

o  Shear  thickening  fluid  (STF)  is  the  non-Newton  fluid  which  increases  itâ€™s  viscosity 
when shear rate exceeds a critical value. In most often, rate of increase of viscosity is 
slow in STF which is one of the major challenges for its application in dissipation of 
kinetic energy during impact 

o  Shear Thickening Gel (STG) shows more stable performance and it is easier to store 
compared  to  its  fluidic  form  which  helps  to  overcome  the  problems  of  particle 
sedimentation and liquid volatilization 

o  By  optimizing 

the  bonding  and  non-bonding 

the  polymeric 
nanocomposite  gels,  DMSRDE  has  prepared  unique  SSG  which  shows  the  change 
in viscosity as a function of shear force and holds a great promise for damping and 
shock energy dissipation  

interactions 

in 

o  Flexible  gel  filled  polymeric  scaffolds/laminated  composites  have  been  prepared  for 

efficient absorption of low to medium velocity impact 

Prototype  of  flexible  STG  filled  laminates  have  been  prepared  and  tested  for  ballistic 
impact applications. The shear thickening mechanism resulted to efficient dissipation of 
energy  by  rearrangement  of  functional  nanofillers  due  to  squeezing  out  of  polymeric 
matrix  from  the  nanoparticle  agglomerates  which  ultimately  resulted  into  thickening  of 
gel. 

The  composite  structure  possesses  efficient  dissipation  of  impact  energies  for 
development  of  dampers,  shock  absorption  for  gun  recoil  system,  fortified  bunkers  or 
ballistic/blast impact personal protection system, anti-piercing shoe sole, stab resistant 
protective  gear,  blast/fire  protection  of  Li  ion  batteries  and  Flexible  self-powered 
triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) etc.
