POSITIVE PRESSURE BREATHING OXYGEN MASK (COMMON MASK)

The use of specific Protective Equipment and Flying Clothing by a

Fighter   Pilot   is   mission   oriented   and   the   importance   of   providing   light

weight   solutions   to   enhance   long   endurance   missions   is   widely

acknowledged.   Pressure   breathing   Oxygen   mask   is   one   of   the   critical

flying clothing products developed under Common Helmet-Mask Program

to   meet   specific   requirements   of   the   Users’   operating   Fighter   Aircrafts.

Mask is  essentially  a  life  saving  device  catering  to controlled  breathing

requirements at high altitudes and hence the item has to be retained in

the head gear and should not lift beyond a limit to prevent exposure of

eyes   to   wind   blast   test   conditions   when   subjected   to   the   effects   of   air

friction during the process of ejection. Thus, the retention of the Mask is of

paramount importance to ensure the safety and survival of the Pilot.

DEBEL   has  designed  and  developed   state   of  art  Positive   pressure

breathing   Oxygen   Mask   for   MiG   21,   HAWK,   Kiran-Jaguar   Aircraft   and

Helicopter   Series   (Cheeta,   Cheetal,   Chetak,   ALH   and   Mi-17   Series)   and

has   met   various   MiL   and   Def.   standards   including   the   wind   blast   test

cleared by RCMA(A/C) for 540/600 KEAS. 

The item has undergone extensive User trials, accepted by Users for

introduction into Service and airworthiness certificate has been accorded

by RCMA (A/C) and RCMA (Hptrs).
