PROCESS TECHNOLOGY OF OLIGO ETHER ACRYLATE (Military Grade) 

 OLIGO ETHER ACRYLATE [Dimethacrylate-bis(triethylene glycol) phthalate] is used 

in single base propellants as a moderant to control the burning rate of propellants. In addition, it 

is  also  used  as  binder  in  production  of  reinforced  plastics,  protective  coatings,  construction 

materials, electric insulation compounds, lacquer, special pastes etc. The material has poor shelf-

life  thus  it  mandates  indigenous  development.  Further,  the  synthesis  of  oligo  ether  acrylate 

involves typical reaction conditions.  

Considering  the  important  and  necessity,  HEMRL  has  developed  a  synthesis  process 

which can be scaled-up for the large scale preparation. 

Process of oligo ether acrylate has been established at 100g/batch. The intermediate and 

final  products  have  been  well  characterized.  Synthesis  involves  two  step  processes  and  is 

sensitive  to  various  reaction  parameters.  After  rigorous  studies,  the  optimal  process  conditions 

have been optimized.
