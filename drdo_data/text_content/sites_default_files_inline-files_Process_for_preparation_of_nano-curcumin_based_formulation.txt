Process for prepration of nano-curcumin based formulation

Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS) has developed a formulation

based on Nanocurcumin (NCF)  which has the potential to maintain the general health at high

altitudes especially the cardiac health including several others. A patent has been granted to

DIPAS on this formulation, preclinical and toxicity studies under GLP condition have been

completed and found to be safe.

Nano-curcumin formulation is a unique formulation containing nanocurcumin and pyrrolo-

quinolinequinine (PQQ), which supplements the brain  and body  to function and adapt  in

severe   stressful   conditions   along   with   increasing   work   endurance.   Curcumin,   a   dietary

pigment obtained from  Curcuma longa,  possesses tremendous therapeutic potential but has

not been used as a drug of choice because of its poor bio-availability and rapid elimination.

We   have   overcome   these   problems   by   nanotizing   curcumin   to   nanocurcumin   while

maintaining its  biological  functions.  While, PQQ is a  naturally occurring  redox co-factor

found in various fruits and vegetables. 

Studies were performed on  in-vivo  animal model (Sprague Dawley rats) as well as on  in-

vitro  model  like Human Ventricular Cardiomyocytes (HVCM) and rodent cardiomyocytes

(H9c2)  showed  anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties, maintains redox status thus

improving overall health by modulating mitochondrial functioning, biogenesis and integrity.

It also increases work endurance and cardiac function.

The toxicity analysis at GLP certified lab established NCF to be safe as per the pre-clinical

requirements of CDSCO. The calculated (extrapolated) LD50 was more than 5000mg/kg bw.

Thus,   the   proposed   use   of   nanocurcumin  formulation  as   a  potential   therapeutic   agent   to

maintain the general health at high altitudes especially the cardiac health including several

others.
