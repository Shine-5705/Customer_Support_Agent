injection of resin. Hence process monitoring sensors fulfill the dual purpose of tracking of 
resin  flow  inside  the  mould  and  controlling  the  resin  input  lines  during  the  sequential 
injection.  
The  process  monitoring  enables  realization  of  large  co-cured  composites  parts  by 
VARTM process.
