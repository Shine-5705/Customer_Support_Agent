PRODUCT INFORMATION FOR MULTIPURPOSE LOAD CARRIAGE
ENSEMBLE 

Problem Identified:

Existing   load   carriage   ensemble   is   not   ergonomically   designed   in   terms   of   sizes,
biomechanical   and   physiological   parameters   and   their   impact   on   musculoskeletal   health.
Load carriage during military operations/school children is gradually increasing due to their
increased curriculum.  Weight and mode of carrying the Rucksack influence the health of due
to postural deviations.
Ideally, load carriage should not be more than 10-15% of the body weight. However, carry
20-30% of their body weight.  Carrying load in a poorly designed bag adds undue stress on
the musculoskeletal system/ spinal column which leads to risk of musculoskeletal disorders.

Innovative approach to solve the problem:

The  Multipurpose  Load   Carriage  Ensemble   (initially   conceived  for  school  children)  is
developed based on Ergonomic principles (load distributed in front and back, considering
biomechanical and postural parameters and sizes) which is modular, lightweight, multiple
pockets, horizontally and vertically adjustability features at waist strap for different height of
users, attachment /detachment facility for using as single pack as well as double pack as per
requirements/   choice.   Sufficient   volume   and   design   features   for   placement   of   items.
Effective designing required to improve musculoskeletal health of students. 

Potential Benefits of the new invention:

 Designed based on principles of ergonomics 
 Efficient in terms of postural and biomechanical load while standing/walking
 Reducing postural strain due to distribution of load
 Help to maintain normal spinal lordosis and kyphosis during standing and walking
 Reduces the magnitudes of work done and power generation in lower body joints
 Minimizes   the   risk   of   spinal   deformities,   back   pain,   musculoskeletal   disorders
