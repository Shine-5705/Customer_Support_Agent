Propellant Casting of Dual Pulse Propulsion System 

HEMRL  has  developed  a  high  energy,  reduced  smoke  composite  propellant  for 

Pulse-I and a high energy  aluminized  composite propellant for Pulse II of an air to surface 

missile.  The  technology  for  propellant  casting  of  dual  pulse  propulsion  system  is  also 

established.    The  propellants  developed  by  HEMRL  have  successfully  demonstrated  their 

performance in number of static tests in standalone as well as integrated mode as well as in 

flight test. Now this technology is completely matured and ready for transferred to industry.
