Pyro Delay Reefing Cutter (1 sec) 

1s Delay pyro reefing cutter is required in the parachute system for Sahayak MK I/NG for IL 

38 aircraft with payload capacity 50 kg. A parachute system is used to decelerate the carrier 

to the desired impact speed, so that impact load does not exceed designated limit. On release 

from the aircraft, the cutter is required to cut the cord after completion of predefined delay to 

initiate  the  parachute  inflation.  The  pyro  cutter  consists  of  a  pyro  delay  ignited  by  a 

mechanically  actuated  percussion  cap  designed  for  deployment  of  parachute.  Burning 

composition sets of a charge which drives the blade into the reefing line, severing it. The pyro 

cutters are required to function with a high degree of accuracy and reliability.
