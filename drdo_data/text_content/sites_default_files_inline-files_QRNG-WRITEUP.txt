    Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)

Random   Number   Generators   have   immense   applications   in   a   lot   of   areas   like   Key
Generation,   Cryptography,   banking,   automotive   industry,   security,   etc.   DRDO   Young
Scientist Laboratory for Quantum Technologies (DYSL-QT), Pune has developed Quantum
Random   Number   Generator   (QRNG)   exploiting   the   principles   of   Quantum   Physics   to
generate true randomness. 

In the approach followed, the spatial superposition property of single photons in fibre-
optic medium is used to generate random numbers. The whole architecture consists of
the following sub-sections.

Pseudo
Single
Photon
Source

Spatial
Superposition
Fiber-Optic Setup

Detection
Unit

Data Extraction
& Processing

The generated single photons  will be in a state of  spatial superposition  after passing
through  the   fiber-optic   setup   which  will   subsequently   be   fed   to   a   pair   of   detectors.
Detector   outputs   will   be   used   to   generate   the   random   data   which   will   be   processed
further using the extraction and processing unit designed using FPGA.

This   developed   architecture-generated   random   numbers   have   been   tested   in-house
using standard Test Suites such as NIST STS, Die-Harder, ENT, etc and have successfully
passed  all  of them. Additionally,  the data  were certified by  one  of the sister-labs  of
DRDO and has undergone performance  evaluation at another DRDO lab.
