RESIN FILM INFUSION 

A  systematic  research  effort 

to  develop 

low-cost 

fabrication  processes 

for 

manufacturing  of  large  composite  structures  has  reached  maturity  at  R&DE(E). 

Resin Film Infusion (RFI) process has been developed for applications such as FRP 

bridges,  armoured  vehicle  hull,  FRP  shelters,  naval  structures  etc.  In  general  this 

technology can be directly applied for development of any large composite structure 

including aerospace structures. Technology for incorporation of nano-fillers has also 

been  established  and  can  be  offered  as  value  addition  to  the  RFI  tape  as  per 

requirement.  

RFI  technique  proprietary  to  R&DE(E)  is  equivalent  to  the  popular  commercially 

available  product  SPRINT,  developed  by  SP  systems,  UK.  The  SPRINT  technique 

has  been  quite  popular  with  the  boat,  racing  car  manufacturers  etc.  RFI  involves 

developing a resin formulation such that resin is cast in the form of film. These resin 

films  are  then  sandwiched  between  fiber  layers,  laid  on  the  tool  and  component 

manufactured  by  vacuum  bagging  technique  under  ambient  pressure  and  high 

temperature.  It  has  been  observed  that  products  made  using  RFI  have  better 

mechanical  properties  comparable  to  prepreg  autoclave  cured  products  with  near 

zero  void  content.  Incorporation  of  nano  materials  for  properties  upgradation  and 

incorporating various functionalities like electrical properties, EMI/EMC can be easily 

done. 

This  technology  offers  possibilities  to  realize  ground  based,  naval  as  well  as 

aerospace  structures  with  high  product  quality  and  lower  cost.  Civilian  and  military 

naval  structures  from  boats,  ship  hulls  etc  are  the  most  logical  target  applications. 

Wind energy, automotive industries can benefit from this technology.
