Radar absorbing Paint

The Radar Cross Section (RCS) of an object is dominated by the radar energy returned

from various scattering  centers of  complex shaped targets. The application of Radar

Absorbing Paint on these scattering centers attenuates the back reflected radar energy

is an effective way of reducing the RCS significantly. These Paints not only have the

required functional properties of radar absorption at the desired frequency bands, but

are also constrained to be thin and to carry minimum weight penalty. Further, they need

to be designed and developed as per the nature of the substrate, and must satisfy the

mechanical and environmental stability. In addition, Paint should be such that it can be

readily applied in a simple and expeditious manner to achieve the functional thickness

on any surface. The proper selection of filler materials and resin matrix is essential to

develop such Paint for realization in practical use. 

Defence   Laboratory,   Jodhpur   has   developed   Polyurethane   based   Radar   absorbing

Paint using magnetic functional filler material for application on strategic targets for RCS

reduction. The polyurethane resin system used in Radar Absorbing Paint has excellent

weathering resistance, and capable of withstand very low and high temperature. The

magnetic   functional   filler   material   with   specific   size   and   shape   has   been   used   in

appropriate ratio in  resin  matrix  to obtain  maximum radar  absorption  properties.  The

developed   paint   has  capability  for   its  application   on  airborne   as  well  as  land   based

strategic targets.

Advantages   of   Technology:  The   developed   Radar   absorbing   Paint   has   following
advantages:

    • Exhibit more than 90% microwave absorption

    • Room temperature drying and curing for application in field conditions

    • Low and high temperature thermal stability

    • Resistance to Hydraulic Oil, Water, Air Turbine Fuel

    • Capable to withstand thermal shock cycling

    • Sustained aerodynamic Vibration

    • Can be applied on Al/Al alloy and CFRP composite surface without affecting the 

structural properties

    • Easy application using spray gun on complex objects
