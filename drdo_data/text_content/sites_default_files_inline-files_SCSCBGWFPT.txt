Silicon Carbide Single Crystal Bulk Growth and Wafer Fabrication 
Process Technology for 4” Diameter Substrates 

RF  technology  is  the  backbone  of  telecommunications  and  radar  for  navigation  and 

safety  system  across  commercial  and  military  aviation,  air  traffic  control,  aircraft  to 

satellite  communications,  space  exploration  and  more. Wide  bandgap  semiconductors 

such as SiC, GaN and AlN show superior material properties which allow operation at 

high switching speed, high voltage, high current density and high temperature. Among 

these,  SiC  present  the  better  trade-off  between  characteristics  and  commercial 

availability  of  the  wafers  and  maturity  of  their  technological  processes.  SiC  substrate 

possesses higher thermal conductivity, better lattice match between SiC and GaN. 

These  wafers  can  be  produced  with  n-type  and  semi-insulating  characteristics  as  per 

the  requirements.  N-type  SiC  wafer  is  an  ideal  substrate  material  for  making  high 

power,  high 

temperature  and  anti-radiation  devices  which  has  got  significant 

applications in electric vehicles, photovoltaic power generation, power transmission etc. 

Solid State Physics Laboratory (SSPL), Delhi has developed single crystal bulk growth 

and  wafer  fabrication  process  technology  to  produce  4”  diameter  silicon  carbide 

substrates.  The  proposed  technology  includes  semi-insulating  as  well  as  N-type  SiC 

substrates.
