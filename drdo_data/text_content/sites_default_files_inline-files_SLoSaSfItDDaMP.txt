Second list of Systems and Subsystems for 
Industry to Design, Develop and Manufacture 

In line with the objective of capitalising the capability of Indian industry for  
design  and  development  of  Defence  System,  DRDO  had  promulgated  a  
list of 108 systems and subsystems which will not be taken up for design & 
development by DRDO. 

In  order  to  give  further  boost  to  the  Defence  R&D  Industrial  Ecosystem, 
2nd list comprising of 75 systems/subsystems that the DRDO labs will not 
take up for design and development and can be taken up by industry has 
been  compiled  and  appended  below.  DRDO  may  provide  scientific/ 
technological  support  (https://drdo.gov.in/industry-support)  and  testing 
the 
for 
support 
development of these systems and subsytems on case to case basis.
