Technology for manufacturing of PBX Composition and its filling in Torpedo Warhead 

Recent  technological  advances  in  the  materials  and  design  of  explosive  ordnance  are  making 

possible the development of a new range of munitions termed Insensitive Munitions (IM) which 

are less vulnerable than existing weapons when subjected to accidental stimuli. Such munitions 

are  less  sensitive  than  their  predecessors to  extreme  but  credible environments  such as  heat, 

shock or impact and remain effective in their intended  application. Introduction of IM compliant 

stores  into  services  will  enhance  the  survivability  of  munitions,  minimize  the  risk  of  injury  to 

personnel  and  provide  more  cost  effective  and  efficient  transport,  potential  for  increased 

munitions density in land limited storage areas and safer handling of munitions. Development of 

less  sensitive  explosive  compositions  requires  use  of  materials  which  desensitize  the  overall 

composition. Polymer bonded explosives (PBX) binder based explosives offer such a solution to 

these  problems.  Polymer  bonded  explosive  (PBX)  is  a  composite  material  in  which  solid 

explosive  is  dispersed  in  a  polymer  matrix.  Cast  PBX  charges  containing  high  explosive  and 

binder find applications in fragmenting charges, shaped charges, blast charges and underwater 

charges.  HEMRL  has  developed  various  less  sensitive  PBX  compositions  which  resulted  in 

successful development of explosive filling for various Naval systems.  

Application areas  

PBHE  102  composition  developed  by  HEMRL  has  been  accepted  as  main  filling  for  torpedo 

warhead based on performance requirements and safety characteristics of the warhead.    

The warhead is designed for use against surface and underwater targets. 

All the trials of the system have been completed successfully in association with certification 
agency and product has been accepted for induction. All the raw materials and process machinery 
for the preparation of explosive composition and filling of warhead system are indigenous.
