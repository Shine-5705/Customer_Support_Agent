SOLAR HEATED SHELTERS 

Solar  heated  shelter  has  been  designed,  developed  and  evaluated  by 
Defence Institute of Physiology & Allied Sciences for reducing dependency on 
fossil fuel in remote off grid locations. The shelter is modular in design and uses 
solar energy for space heating and electricity generation. The shelter has steel 
grillage  foundation  making  it  suitable  even  for  areas  of  soil  with  low  bearing 
capacity. The superstructure is made of modular panels for ease of transport to 
remote locations. The solar shelter is designed to endure wind speeds of upto 
198 km/hr and snow load of upto 2m. The polycarbonate roof design prevents 
accumulation  of  snow  and  allows  optimal  trapping  of  solar  heat  inside  the 
shelter. The excessive solar heat is  trapped  in Phase Change Materials (PCM) 
during  the  sunlight  periods  and  is  released  for  space  heating  during  evening 
hours  and  cloudy  weather  conditions.  It  has  integrated  toilet  and  insulated 
water  tank  for  providing  tap  water  in  extreme  cold  conditions.  The  CO2, 
temperature sensors and fire alarm system provide safety features comparable 
to  international  standards.  Electricity  is  generated  through  ground  mounted 
solar  panels  and  stored  in  Lithium  ion  batteries.  The  shelter  is  ergonomically 
designed for optimal utilization of space to provide comfortable habitability. The 
solar heated shelter provides an eco-friendly habitability solution for extreme 
weather  conditions  ranging  from  -40  oC  to  +  40  oC  in  remote  locations  by 
reducing fuel dependency. Being modular, it can be constructed in customizable 
sizes based on habitability requirement viz., 4 men, 6 men, 50 men etc and space 
available.
