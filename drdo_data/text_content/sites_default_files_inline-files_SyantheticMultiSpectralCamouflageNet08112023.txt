Synthetic Multi Spectral Camouflage Net 

Protection of military systems and personnel is of paramount importance in the warfare scenario 
or otherwise  and  it  is  becoming  extremely  difficult  with the  advent of  highly  sensitive  sensors 
working in  the  range of  IR,  thermal, visual  and  microwaves.  Camouflaging  of  such  systems is 
the  most  advanced  mechanism  to  avoid  /  delay  the  detection  and  identification  of  objects  in 
stationary or dynamic conditions.       

DMSRDE is the pioneer lab in the field of fabric based camouflage systems. In the past, series of 
fabric based camouflaging systems like SCN, RSCN, MSPCE, MCS etc. have been designed and 
developed.    Synthetic  Multi  Spectral  Camouflage  Net  (MSCN)  has  been  developed  to  meet 
customized requirements of Armed Forces and it is presently being used  in field conditions, as 
semi-permanent  camouflaging  shelter.  It  is  anticipated  that  Indian  Armed  Forces  would  be 
requiring such systems in near future.  

Product  Description:  The  synthetic  MSCN  is  a  3-D  structured  double  layer  configuration  of 
PVC  coated  nylon  and  PU  coated  mesh  structured  polyester  fabric  of  different  shades.  The 
incised structure provides the 3-D shape when adequately stretched during deployment. Tri-lobal 
disruptive  patterns  /  colour  combinations,  NIR  reflective  pigments  and  conducting  yarns 
provides the camouflage efficacy in visual range regions. Also have low water absorption, flame 
retardant and self-extinguishable properties.  

Applications:  

Developed synthetic MSCN can be used for camouflaging of stationary military objects / troops 
shelters,  and  it  can  be  customized  as  per  the  object  dimensions  /  geometry,  geographical  and 
terrain  conditions.  Due  to  its  rugged  nature  and  high  wind  sustainability  it  is  suitable  for  all 
terrains with long operational usages.
