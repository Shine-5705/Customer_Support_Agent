Systems and Subsystems for Industry to Design, Develop and Manufacture 

Indigenous  design,  development  and  manufacturing  of  advanced  defence  systems  require  building  of  able 
defence  ecosystem  with  industry.  In  line  with  the  aim  of  ‘Atmanirbhar  Bharat’,  it  is  appropriate  that  the 
industry takes over development of technologies and systems where it has developed the capabilities. To this 
effect, DRDO has identified following 108 systems and subsystems which will be designed, developed and 
manufactured  by  industry  only  and  will  not  be  taken  up  by  DRDO  itself  for  development.  DRDO  may 
testing  support 
provide  scientific/ 
(https://drdo.gov.in/test-facilities)  wherever  required  for  the  development  of  these  systems  and  subsystems 
on case to case basis.
