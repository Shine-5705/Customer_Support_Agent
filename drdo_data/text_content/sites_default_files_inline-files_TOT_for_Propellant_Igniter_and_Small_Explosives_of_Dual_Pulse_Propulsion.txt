TOT for Propellant, Igniter and Small Explosives of Dual Pulse Propulsion 

Dual pulse propulsion system comprises of two rocket motors designated as pulse-1 and pulse-2.
Reduced smoke, high energy composite propellant is developed for pulse-1 rocket motor and high
burning  rate   propellant   is   developed   for   pulse-   2   rocket   motor.   For   ignition   of   rocket   motors,
igniters cotaining   boron based pyrotechnic composition (torch type for pulse-I and disc type for
pulse-2) and small explosives (detonators, TBI and explosive bolt) are also develped for both the
rocket motors. The performance of propellant, igniter and small explosives has been sucessfully
demonstrated in several static and flight tests.  The manufacturing technology of propellant , igniter
and small explosives of dual pulse propulsion is established. 

Now this technolgy is completely matured and the same can be transferred to production agencies
for further requirement.
