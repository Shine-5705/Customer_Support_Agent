ToT proposal – Uprated 1000 hp engine  

Weight of T-72 tank has been increased from 41t to 44t with addition of various value added 
modules.    To  improve  the  mobility  characteristics,  CVRDE  uprated    power  output  of  existing 
engine of T-72 tank produced by Ordnance Factory Board from 780 hp to 1000 hp.   

Power  was  uprated  by  retaining  core  engine  components  and  replacing  only  peripheral 
systems  of  engine  like  intake  system,  exhaust  system,  cooling  &  lubrication  system.  The 
engine had successfully undergone 400 hrs endurance testing.  

The  uprated  engine  has  been  integrated  within  the  existing  vehicle  compartment  and  the 
compartment  requires  minor  modifications.  To  cater  for  the  requirement  of  1000  hp  engine, 
higher  capacity  efficient  air  filtration  and  compact  cooling  system  has  been  integrated  within 
the available vehicle compartment.  

The uprated engine was extensively evaluated at Avadi and various desert locations. The 
engine  had  completed  User  trials  at  desert  conditions  in  summer  and  medium  fording 
evaluation.  All  the  upgradation  modules  like  Turbocharger,  Charge  air  cooler,  Water  pump,  
Exhaust manifold, oil filter, air filtration system and cooling system are indigenously available.  
Also,  this  upgradation  is  a  proven,  easy,  time  saving,  cost  effective  and  totally  indigenous 
solution.   

Army  is  planning  to  upgrade  the  existing  fleet  of  T-72  Tanks  with  1000  hp  engine  and  its 
associated  system  through  `MAKE’  category.  Hence  ToT  for  upgradation  of  T-72  Tanks  with 
Uprated 1000 hp engine and its associated systems is available to Indian industries.
