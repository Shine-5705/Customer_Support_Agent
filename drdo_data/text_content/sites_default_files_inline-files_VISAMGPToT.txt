Automated Gun Propellant Metrology System  -VisAM GP 

Gun propellants grains are of different compositions, and are designed to meet the internal
ballistics  requirements  of various  calibres  of guns. Other than  the chemical  composition,
dimensions  of gun propellant  grains  are  also very important  parameters  in the  design of
grains for fulfilling the internal ballistic requirements. To ensure that the manufactured grains
are within the design tolerance, various dimensions such as sizes of inner web, outer web,
diameter of inner holes, outer diameter and length etc are measured on a sample size of grains
drawn from manufactured lot. The physical dimensions of gun propellant grains are not only
important in inspection of grains, but they are also very important parameters for internal
ballistics evaluation of gun propellant (GP) grains. The manual process of measurement is
time consuming and is also prone to errors as the consistency of measurement varies from
person to person. Hence there was a requirement for the development of an automated gun
propellant metrology system.

DRDO   Laboratory   High   Energy   Materials   Research   Laboratory   (HEMRL),   Pune     has
designed and developed an Automated Gun Propellant Metrology System-VisAM GP (Vision
assisted Automated Measurement Gun Propellant) for accurate and robust measurement of
simple as well as complex geometry of gun propellant grains. The system has capability of
automated   and   simultaneous   measurement   of   dimensions   of   GP   Grains   such   as  outer
diameter, outer web(s), diameter of internal hole(s), inner web(s) & length of the grain etc,
without requiring a person to perform any manual measurements. The system also performs
statistical analysis for automated calculation of Average Web size, Average outer diameter
etc for a batch of large numbers of grains, which assists the user to accept or reject the batch
under inspection. 

VisAM GP online metrology and inspection of gun propellants in a production line, to save
the time, efforts and manpower requirements for the end user. 

The salient features of Automated Gun Propellant Metrology System 

 Simultaneous measurement across multiple axis.
 Automated, reliable, faster and accurate measurement.
 Measurement for different shapes of grains.
 Non contact method without manual intervention.
 Automated detection of grain features such as holes and outer boundary.
 Image processing algorithms  for inspection of Grains  with complex geometry and

shape.

 Menu to create a new record for storing the measurement of fresh batch, and also to

update the results in the existing record for earlier batch.

 Automated calculation of statistical parameters such as average web, average OD etc

for a batch of grains.

 Scalability for inspection of newer type of grain with different geometry, shape &

color.
