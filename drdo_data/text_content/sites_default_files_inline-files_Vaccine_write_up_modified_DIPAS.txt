An effective vaccine against typhoid and Salmonellosis in animals and humans using 
Dnak protein (member of Hsp 70 of family) of S Typhi 

Salmonellosis  is  a  hyper-endemic  disease  in  India  affecting  both  man  and  animals  alike. 
Typhoid,  caused  by  Salmonella  Typhi  is  still  an  unsolved  problem  in  the  majority  of  the 
world.  Rapid  emergence  of  MDR  strains  and  limited  usefulness  of  presently  available 
vaccines  has  made  the  control  of  Salmonellosis  very  difficult  proposition.Furthermore,  in 
recent  years,  the  realized  threat  from  biological  attack  has  necessitated  the  development  of 
medical  countermeasures  to  protect  against  virulent  pathogens  and  Salmonella  could  be  a 
potential bio-threat agent which may lead to high morbidity and even mortality. The currently 
available vaccines (Vi) are only 55–70% protective, have side effects, thus, licensed for use 
from age two years and older. Vivotif,a live vaccine, is in the form of capsules,therefore, not 
suitable for children andis contraindicated in immune compromised host. 

As  a  novel  vaccination  approach,  DIPAS,  DRDO  has  developed  Heat  shock  protein  (Hsp) 
based candidate vaccine molecules rHsp60 (GroEL) and rHsp70 (DnaK) against Salmonella 
and reported these molecules to be highly effective in mouse model. 

Highlights of these vaccine candidate molecules: 

•  Stimulate  both  humoral  and  cell  mediated  immune  responses  unlike  Vi  vaccine 

which stimulates predominantly humoral responses. 

•  Higher Protection (80-90%) than Vi (60-70%) in mouse model. 
Publications: Clinical Immunology (2008), 126: 89-96. IF 4.0; 
Vaccine (2011), 29: 6532-6539. IF 3.6 

•  Effective even in the absence of adjuvants which is an absolute requirement for the 

• 

traditional vaccines with side effects. 
Publication: Mol CellBiochem (2010), 337:213-221. IF 2.6 
Immense  potential  to  be  developed  as  single  vaccine  candidate  molecule  against 
multiple pathogens.  
Publication: Vaccine (2013), 31: 2035– 2041. IF 3.6. 

•  Promising  carrier  molecules  for  enhancing  antigenicity  of  poor  antigensas  we 

reported against Shigella.

(Nature publication group);Vaccine (2016), 34: 5376-5383. IF 3.6 

•  Great potential to be used as animal vaccines for preventing Salmonellosis in poultry 

and cattle as there is > 99.5 % homology with its closely related serovars. 

Patents granted:  
i) Indian patent : A vaccine effective against typhoid’, Patent no. 259393,  March 11, 2014 
ii) US patent no. US 8241645 B2, granted on August 14, 2012 
iii) European patent EP 1931389 B1, granted on July 14, 2010.  

In addition to its utmost usefulness to our armed forces, who often have to face vagaries of 
nature  and  exposure  to  unhygienic  conditions  in  the  line  of  their  duty,  this  innovation  has 
great potential to be developed as vaccine for general population, as well as animals, against 
Salmonella and multiple pathogens.
