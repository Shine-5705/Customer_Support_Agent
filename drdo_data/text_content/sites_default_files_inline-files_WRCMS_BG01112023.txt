Water Radioactivity Contamination Monitoring System (Beta, Gamma) 

Water  Radioactivity  Contamination  Monitoring  System  (Beta,  Gamma)  [WRCMS  (β,  γ)] 
technology  has  been  developed  by  Defence  Laboratory,  Jodhpur  for  measurements  of 
radioactivity (due to beta & gamma radioisotopes) present in water and to be used with  CBRN 
Water  Purifications  System  Mk-II.  The  system  has  been  designed  &  developed  to  measure 
contamination levels in feed & purified water during Nuclear & Radiological Emergency scenerio. 
It  is  a  rugged  portable  system  developed  through  rigorous  design,  fabrication  &  validation 
process.  It  is  operable  in  Desert,  Plains  and  High  Altitude  area  with  sub-zero  temperature 
storage capability. 

Salient Features are as follows: 

  Portable & Dismountable, User Friendly, Suitable for vehicle also. 

  Weight:65 kg (with packaging), 35 kg (without packaging) 

  Detector: β- Plastic Scintillator, γ- Nal(TI) Scintillator 

 

Identification of Gamma Radiosotopes  

  Minimum Detectable Activity: Less than 100 Bq/L 

  Audio & Video warning adjustment alarms 

  Gross Activity Computation &  Contamination Report Generation 

  Ruggedized Control & Display Unit 
  Operatiing Temperature:50C to 550C ± 30C 
  EMI/EMC compatible as per MIL STD 461 E  

  Environmentally rugged as per JSS 55555 

Application: 

  Nuclear Disaster Management  

  Radiological Emergency Management 

  Nuclear Reactor Off-site Management 

  Peace time baseline radioactivity measurement 

                                                 [WRCMS (β,γ)]
