P-7 Heavy Drop Parachute system

ADRDE, a pioneer in the field of Aerial Delivery Systems, has designed and developed the Heavy

Drop  P-7   Parachute   system   to   airdrop   9.5  Ton   (Max   all   Up  mass)   class   payload   using   IL   76

Aircraft. The P-7 heavy drop system comprises of Parachute system and Platform system. The

parachute system is designed to air drop a payload ranging from 5 ton to 9.5 ton. The parachute

system is three stage system.  In the first stage Extractor  parachute  pulls  out the payload from

aircraft and then initiates twin canopy of auxiliary parachute system. Auxiliary parachutes pull and

assist in deployment of main parachute and brake parachute system. The main parachute system is a

cluster of five canopies. After deployment, the Main Para brings the payload to steady state and

safe Rate of Descent.  

The P-7 Parachute System consists of four main subsystems. 

 Extractor Parachute system (Nos. of canopies : 01 X 8 m2)

 Auxiliary parachute system (Nos. of canopies :02 X 13.5 m2)

 Brake parachute system (Nos. of canopies :05 X 13.5 m2)

 Main parachute system (Nos. of canopies : 05 X 760 m2)

Number of other components like metal parts, automatic activation devices (AAD), Deployment

bags/pack covers, textile components etc. are also part of the system. The finer details regarding

the same will be shared at a later stage after signing the CNDA.
