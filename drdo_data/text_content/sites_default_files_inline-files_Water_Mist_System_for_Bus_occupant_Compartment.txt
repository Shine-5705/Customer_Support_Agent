Water Mist System for Bus occupant Compartment 
Fire Protection System

A Fire Protection and Alarm System (FP&AS) for standard bus passenger (or,
occupant) compartment has been designed and developed by Centre for Fire
Explosive and Environment Safety (CFEES), as a spin-off technology. 

Based on fire risk assessment of the standard bus the heat and smoke in the
passenger   compartment   is   controlled,   thus   providing   additional   evacuation
time through effective thermal management during fire incidents, by providing
FP&AS.  

A water-mist based fire protection and fire alarm system for buses has been
designed   to   manage   the   temperature   in   the   passenger   compartment   upto
50oC.  The   developed   system   in   the   passenger   (occupant)   compartment
includes   a   network   of   tubing   with   suitable   number   of   atomizers   linked   to   a
water tank of appropriate capacity, along with a pressurized nitrogen cylinder.
The fire alarm system comprises of smoke detectors wired to a control panel
which is to be installed near the  driver seat with the  provision of an audio-
visual alarm in case of fire.

The system developed by CFEES for occupant compartment reduces the risk to
life and property and give active protection measure on its implementation and
complies   with   AIS-135   for   occupant   compartment.   The   same   is   being
implemented   in   the   Occupant   Compartment   in   ‘Type   III’   Vehicles   (those   are
designed   and   constructed   for   long   distance   passenger   transport,   for   seated
passengers) and School Buses.

This   technology   is   available   for   transfer   to   the   interested   industry   for
commercialization.
