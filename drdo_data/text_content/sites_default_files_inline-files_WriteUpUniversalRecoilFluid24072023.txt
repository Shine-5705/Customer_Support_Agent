Universal Recoil Fluid (URF) 

DRDO  lab  DMSRDE,  Kanpur  has  developed  Universal  Recoil  Fluids  (URF)  using  ethyl  alcohol, 

glycerol  and  water  in  definite  proportions  fortified  with  suitable  corrosion  inhibitors  to  guard  against 

corrosion  of  various  metals.  These  fluids  are  miscible  with  water  in  all  proportions.  Currently,  three 

versions of URF are in use viz URF Plain, URF 75:25 and URF 80:20. These fluids have very low and 

different freezing points. These fluids are anticorrosive towards mild steel, brass and bronze metals and 

also non-reactive towards various rubber seals. After exhaustive trials these fluids were introduced in to 

services. The fluids are used in recoil system of various artillery guns.
