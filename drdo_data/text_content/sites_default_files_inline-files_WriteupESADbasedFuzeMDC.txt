ESAD based Fuze for Mini Depth Charge (MDC) 

DRDO lab TBRL, Chandigarh developed Mini depth charge is a hand emplaced weapon used against 
enemy troops entering coastal areas. The charge needs to be detonated at a pre-programmed depth and 
generate a destructive hydraulic shock. The existing MDC uses a pyro delay-based fuze uses primary 
explosive  based  detonator  which  are  sensitive  to  heat,  friction,  shock  and  EMI.  To  overcome  these 
limitations TBRL has designed and developed a fourth generation electronic safe and arm fuze. In this 
design  an  intrinsically  safe  secondary  explosive  based  inline  explosive  train  is  used  which  enhances 
the safety of the weapon during transportation, storage and operational scenario. The developed fuze 
has following features:- 

1.  Fourth generation ESAD based fuzing technology. 
2.  Compatible with existing fuze interface of MDC. 
3.  Accurate electronic time-delay-based depth mapping. 
4.  Fuze arming through hydrostatic pressure switch. 
5.  Manual knob for depth setting. 
6.  Inline explosive train. 
7.  MIL-STD 1316F Compliance. 

The design is the combination of rugged and reliable mechanical safeties and accurate electronic delay. 
A COTS primary battery having long shelf life is used as power source. An indigenously developed 
hydrostatic  pressure  switch  is  used  for  arming  the  fuze  after  reaching  the  required  depth.  The 
developed fuze has been qualified as per user specifications and successfully cleared under water trials 
in the laboratory. The ToT partner is expected to produce required number of fuzes and get involved 
with the design team during final qualification tests followed by user trials. Detonator will be provided 
by TBRL at the prevailing cost at the time as the same is not part of ToT.
