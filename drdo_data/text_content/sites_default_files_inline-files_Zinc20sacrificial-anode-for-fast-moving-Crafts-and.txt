NMR - Zinc sacrificial anode for fast moving Crafts and
Jet propulsion system (NMR - ZSA)
The present invention relates to the development of zinc alloy based high negative potential
sacrificial anode for cathodic protection of structural steel(low Alloy) and marine grade Al alloys
in marine environment. More particularly the present invention relates to the cathodic protection
of structural steels and marine grade Al alloys with seawater flow rate more than 10 m/s where
conventional Al alloy based sacrificial anodes cannot be used. This alloy of invention can function as
sacrificial anode in the temperature range 0-500 C and various seawater and saline water including
seawater mud.

SALIENT FEATURES

The property of Zinc anode has the following features:

 Open circuit potential : -1000 to -1050 mV vs SCE
 Closed circuit potential : -950 to -1010 mV vs SCE
 Current capacity : min 730 Ahr/Kg

The anodes are available in different shape and size, so that anodes 
can be selected as per requirement of the user. Also the anodes are 
designed to give maximum current output.
