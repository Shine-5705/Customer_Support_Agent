i) 

Description of Technology :  

Terrorist strikes in Urban areas have brought a new challenge before security 
forces.    Aftermath  of  26/11/2008  terrorist  attack  on  Taj  hotel  and  other  places  in 
Mumbai, dictated the need for an agile, compact with weight and dimensional profile, 
highly  maneuverable armoured envelope adequately protected to  carry 2/3 persons 
in  hostile  environment  especially  in  the  corridors  of  buildings,  small  gullies, 
constrained spaces of hide outs etc for Anti-Terrorist operation.   

Therefore,  Anti-Terrorist  vehicle  (Tracked)  has  been  indigenously  developed 
taking  into  consideration  various  aspects  like  weight  and  dimensional  profile, 
accommodation  of  3  persons,  all  round  ballistic  and  blast  protection,  better  firing 
capability  and  capability  negotiate  to  small  gullies  and  narrow  lanes  during 
operations. The vehicle has been trial evaluated by the users.
