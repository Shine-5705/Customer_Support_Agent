Expression of Interest 

TOT OF ON-BOARD ELECTRONICS SUB-SYSTEM  
FOR ADVANCED LIGHT TOWED ARRAY SONAR (ALTAS) 

1.  Introduction 

NPOL,  Kochi,  a  premier  laboratory  under  Defence  R&D  Organisation  invites 

Expression of Interest (EOI) from Indian manufacturer(s) having sufficient experience, 

expertise  and  willingness  to  undertake  Production  of  ON-BOARD  ELECTRONICS 

SUB-SYSTEM for an Advanced Light Towed Array Sonar (ALTAS).  

Block Diagram of On-board Electronics Sub-System 

The on-board electronics Sub-system processes the information received from the 

Wet End Electronics and displays credentials of contact. The on-board electronics 

sub-system is housed in 6 cabinets. There are two numbers of Display cum processor 

cabinets, one power supply cabinet, two power amplifier cabinet and one data 

recorder cabinet 

Technical specifications are enclosed at annexure 1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANUFACTURER OF ONBOARD ELECTRONICS  

SUB-SYSTEM 

ALTAS  is a  multidisciplinary  sonar  system  consisting  of  technologies  of  transducers, 

mechanical  engineering,  ocean  engineering,  electrical  and  electronics  engineering, 

power electronics and software. Realisation of the entire sonar system under one roof 

may not be practical because of the diversity of technologies, know-how and skill set 

required.  And  hence  the  hardware  content  of  the  sonar  has  been  realised  as 

subsystems  through  specialised  Indian  industries  and  integrated  as  ALTAS  sonar 

system by incorporating dedicated software developed by NPOL. The responsibility of 

its  installation  onboard  a  naval  ship  and  the  role  of  lead  system  integrator  was 

undertaken by NPOL. The performance validation of the system was done under the 

leadership  of    NPOL  and  with  the  association  of  Indian  Navy  through  a  series  of 

structured  sea  trials  with  real  targets  deployed  at  strategic  locations.  Performance 

validation has since been completed, the Indian Navy will shortly evaluate the system 

as  per  mutually  agreed  trial  plan  and  procedure.    Indian  Navy  has  plans  to  induct  a 

few ALTAS sonar systems for its front line war ships soon after evaluation trials. The 

purpose of this EOI is to identify one / two potential Manufacturer for ALTAS On-board 

Electronic  System.        Responsibilities  of  Sub-system  manufacturer  of  ‘On-board 

Electronic System’ is further elaborated in the succeeding sections. 

2.1  Supply  of  Sub-system  to  Lead  System  Integrator  (LSI)  nominated  by  Indian 

Navy/NPOL 

a.  Supply  order  will  be  placed  on  the  manufacturer  by  a  LSI  nominated  by  Indian 

Navy/NPOL. 

b.  Manufacturer  will  supply  the  On-board  electronics  system  as  per  TOT  Documents. 

Detailed Specifications, Quality policy / program for component level to  sub-system 

level,  ATP,  FAT’s,  HAT’s  and  SAT’s  documents  and    BOM  will  be  provided  in  the 

TOT documents. 

c.  The  manufacturer  will  field  sub-system  against  RFP  from  LSI  by  submitting 

Technical, commercial and price bids appropriately. 

2.2  Organising QT/ET/ATP at the premises of sub-system manufacturer. 

a.  Manufacturer  has  to  organise  QT/ET  at  the  manufacturers  end  as  per  sub-system 

acceptance document provided in the TOT document.  

 
 
b.  Manufacturer  has  to  conduct  FAT’s  at  the  manufacturers  end  as  per  sub-system 

Factory  acceptance  document  provided  in  the  TOT  document  before  despatch  of 

sub-system for system Integration. 

2.3  Auditing of Quality Process 

a.  Manufacturer  will  ensure  auditing  of  quality  process  by  competent  authority 

responsible for quality assurance as spelt out by LSI. 

b.  LSI  will  have  the  right  to  nominate  Competent  authority  responsible  for  quality 

assurance and inspection at the manufacturers premises. 

3.  TOT TERMS

quality of manufacture within the limitations in hand-holding support of DRDO. 

3.2  TOT will be given on non-exclusive basis only. The number of license on non-exclusive 

basis will be  restricted.  However,  additional licence  if  required  will  be  given  by  DRDO 

on need basis. The intellectual property rights shall always remain with DRDO.  

3.3  The  amount  and  payment  stages  of  TOT  fee  will  be  as  prescribed  by  DRDO.  As  per 

current guidelines it is upto 20% of its developmental cost. 

3.4  Royalty fee @ 2% of the annual sales will be applicable uniformly for all industries. 

3.5   Technical  assessment  of  the  industries  submitting  EOI’s  will  be  carried  out  by  a 

Technical  assessment  committee  for  verification  of  the  technical  and  financial 

capability/capacity of the industry. 

3.6  Eligible  parties  will  have  to  sign  Confidentiality  &  Non-Disclosure  Agreement  (CNDA) 

with DRDO for technical discussion including specifications, following  which they shall 

be considered for giving Transfer of Technology (TOT) on non-exclusive basis. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.7  TOT  to  industry  will  be  given  based  on  their  manufacturing  capability,  assurance  on 

quality and capacity of production apart from other terms and conditions.  

3.8  The licencing agreement for transfer of technology (LATOT) which is to be signed will 

be  as  per  the  template  approved  by  Department  of  Legal  affairs.  Ministry  of  Law  and
