Payload electronics and SAM System for UAV Launched Precision Guided Missile V2 

(ULPGM-V2) 

I.  PAYLOAD ELECTRONICS SYSTEM 

Introduction  

The payload electronics under consideration is a micro controller based intelligent system which 

is  interfaced  with  day/night  seeker  system  (EO),  RF  communication  transceiver,  Control  unit, 

Aerial Platform, as well as manages the V2 missile Power on-board. Its configuration consists of 

two electronic boards which are electrically interfaced with rest of the missile. The MCU based 

board  (mother-board)  transmit  and  receive  commands.  The  payload  mother-board  will  have 

number of independent sensors/logic's on-board to perform the desired operations with EO and 

SAM electronics.  

Payload Modules comprises of following: - 

a.  Power Electronics Board 

b.  Release Sense & Safe-Arming Unit 

c.  RF Electronics & Wireless transceiver Board 

d.  Mother-Board Electronics 

II.  SAM ELECTRONICS SYSTEM 

Missile safety and operational effectiveness are closely linked to the way the explosive warhead 

is initiated. Modern munitions demand enhanced safety over the complete logistical and tactical 

cycles. SAM is equipped with three safeties namely, ARM, CHARGE and FIRE. It operates only 

on getting or generating specific input based on various events or timings of flight trajectory. The 

interlocks  are  bound  to  minimum  three  totally  independent  physical  or  time  events  of  flight 

trajectory  of  missile.  The  health  of  SAM  can  be  ascertained  during  its  operational  lifetime 

without compromising safety. 

III.  Terms and Conditions for EOI 

a.  Documents  to  be  submitted  with  EoI.  The  company  must  provide  details  about 

company and documents in support of their claim. Any additional documents as required  

      by DRDO shall be sought based on request received from the interested industries. 

b.  The  industry  should  essentially  have  experience  in  fabrication  and  qualification  of  

        on-board electronics/ similar system. 

 
 
 
 
c.  The  Industry  should  also  have  skilled  manpower,  established  quality  control  team, 

willingness and capability to setup specialized infrastructure (Load test facilities, FRA,    

Recorder, Power Supplies etc). 

d.  The Other Terms and conditions for industry seeking ToT are as per the ‘DRDO Policy 

and Procedures for ToT’ for Category ‘A’.
