Thermobaric Explosive Composition PBTE 201 for bombs 

Thermobaric (TB) explosive compositions are fuel rich formulations capable to create sustained 
high temperature and longer duration overpressure as compared to conventional high explosives. 
The percentage, nature and size distribution of fuel particles are chosen to achieve the enhanced 
blast and thermal effects. The state-of-art technology of preparation of TB explosive composition 
has been indigenously developed at High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL). The 
developed  TBE  compositions  belong  to  polymer  bonded  explosive  (PBX)  type  which  has  the 
added advantage of insensitivity or low vulnerability when compared to conventional melt cast 
compositions.  

The  developed  TB  formulation  PBTE  201  is  a  composite  material  in  which  solid  explosive 
particles  are  dispersed  in  a  polymer  matrix.  The  compositions  are  prepared  by  mixing  binder, 
high explosive and other ingredients in a suitable mixer. The explosive slurry is then filled into 
the warheads by casting under vacuum. 

Trials including User associated trials of bombs in static and flight modes have been completed 
successfully.  All  the  raw  materials  and  process  machinery  for  the  preparation  of  explosive 
composition and filling of warhead system are indigenously available 

Application Areas:  

The composition has been proved for application in aircraft bombs. It can be utilized in warheads 
deployed against targets in open /confined spaces or in applications where thermobaric effect is 
required.
