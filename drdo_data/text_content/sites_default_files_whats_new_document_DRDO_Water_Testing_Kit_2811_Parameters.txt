DRDO Water Testing Kit (11 Parameters) 

The water testing kit developed by DRDO provides the facility for testing physical, chemical 

and  bacteriological  (coliform  bacteria)  quality  of  water  in  the  field  condition.  It  enables  to  test 

eleven  (11)  selected  physico-chemical  parameters  including  fecal  contamination  of  water.  It  takes 

about  1  hour  to  test  the  physico-chemical  parameters  and  about  6-12  hours  to  test  the 

presence/absence  fecal  organism  (coliform).  The  kit  is  provided  with  stores  viz.  glass  &  plastic 

wares, arsine generator set, TDS meter, incubator etc. and sufficient reagent and test strips to test for 

100 water samples. All the items required for the tests are contained in a portable box to facilitate 

easy  carrying.  The  standard  colour  charts  are  used  to  provide  for  comparison  of  test  solution  for 

estimation of various parameters in the water sample. 

Main features: 

➢  The  test  parameters  (qualitatively)  are;  pH,  Total  Hardness,  Residual  Chlorine,  Chloride, 

Fluoride, Nitrate, Sulphate, Iron, Arsenic, TDS and Bacteria 

➢  The tests results are performed on ‘Accept’/’Reject’ basis 

➢  The Kit is cheap and easy to carry in the field 

➢  One unskilled person can determine the parameters of drinking water 

➢  A single kit can analyze 100 samples with accuracy and precision
