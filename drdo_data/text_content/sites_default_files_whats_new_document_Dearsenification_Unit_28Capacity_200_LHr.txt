Dearsenification Unit (Capacity 200 L/Hr) 

In  recent  days,  the  arsenic  contamination  in  ground  water  of  NE  India  is  in  an  alarming 

condition. DRL, DRDO Tezpur has developed dearsenification unit to provide arsenic free drinking 

water.  The  cylindrical  water  dearsenification  unit  consists  of  an  aeration  system  with  cover,  four 

chambers viz. sedimentation, up flow filtration, gravity flow filtration and filtered water chamber. 

These chambers are housed in the cylindrical main body and separated by partition. The chambers 

are connected by holes for flow of water. The unit also contains a charge holder, a doser for lime, 

sludge/backwash outlet valves and a filtered water outlet.          

Main features: 

➢  Adequate aeration facility  

➢  Arsenic  content  of  the  treated  water  through  this  unit  within  WHO  standards  (<  10  ppb) 

from water having dissolved arsenic up to 500 ppb. 

➢  Major portion of arsenic and iron precipitate/ co-precipitate in sedimentation chamber 

➢  Double filtration ensures better removal  

➢  Efficient backwashing system 

➢  Easy operation and maintenance 

➢   Filtration rate: 200 L/hr (approx).
