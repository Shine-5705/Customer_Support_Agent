Household Water Purification Unit 

The household water purification unit (capacity 20L) developed by DRL, DRDO Tezpur 

provides pure drinking water by removing the harmful contaminants present in water. It enables 

to  remove  three  main contaminants  viz.  arsenic,  iron  and manganese from  drinking  water but 

retaining other essential dissolved salt/ions in the water. The unit is made of food grade plastic 

material and consists of an aeration pump and two cylindrical chambers. The first chamber unit 

which contains (i) the aeration system, (ii) two nos. of ceramic candles and (iii) the pH adjuster 

tray suspended between the ceramic candles. The second chamber is having two nos. of layered 

filter  candles.  The  second  chamber  is  placed  on  the  stand,  on  which,  the  aeration  pumps  is 

attached.  The  aeration  pump  has  dual  operation  function  that  can  be  operated  either  by  using 

electricity through an adapter provided or by using battery (in case no electricity is available). 

Main features: 

➢  It can remove arsenic, manganese and iron from contaminated water 

➢  Can be operated successfully without electricity with filtration rate 1.5 litres/hr 

➢  Made of food grade plastic materials and consist of two cylindrical chambers 

➢  Equipped with an aeration system, which helps in enhancing the removal of target  

contaminants 

➢  Removal efficiency; 

a)  Arsenic     : 200 ppb to  10 ppb  

b)  Iron  

: 30 ppm to  0.3 ppm  

c)  Manganese: 2 ppm to  0.1 ppm
