Iron Removal Unit (Capacity 300 L/Hr) 

Iron  at  higher  concentration  in  water  is  objectionable  owing  to  the  production  of 

discoloration, turbidity, deposition in distribution systems apart from astringent taste. Water quality 

of most parts of NE region of India is ferruginous in nature. In view of these, to provide iron free 

drinking water, Iron Removal Unit (IRU) has been developed by DRL, DRDO Tezpur, which needs 

no electricity to run. The iron removal unit is cylindrical in shape and consists of an aeration system 

with cover, four chambers viz. sedimentation, up flow filtration, gravity flow filtration and filtered 

water  chamber.  These  chambers  are  housed  in  the  cylindrical  main  body  and  separated  by 

partitions. The chambers are connected by holes for flow of water. During the filtration process the 

pH of the water is adjusted by dropwise addition of lime water and aeration is done by gas transfer.  

Oxidation  of  ferrous  to  ferric  ions  takes  place  and  iron  is  precipitated  as  sediments.  The  removal 

takes place by dual processes, which includes up filtration & gravity flow filtration. IRUs have been 

installed in several Army, Air Force, Paramilitary and Civilian units in NE India.  

Main features: 

➢  Adequate aeration facility 

➢  Major portion of iron settles in sedimentation chamber 

➢  Filter bed cracking prevented and clogging delayed 

➢  Double filtration ensures better iron removal  

➢  It can remove iron from 40 ppm to <0.3ppm. 

➢  Efficient backwashing system 

➢  Easy operation and maintenance  

➢  Filtration rate: 300 L/Hr (approx.)
